While moms have been using them to pack their kids nutrient-packed meals, the boxes are winning over adults who want to eat more balanced, portion-controlled meals on the go—without using every Tupperware container in their kitchen. </p><p>These boxes have been popping up all over Instagram, with fit foodies sharing images of their healthy lunches and on-the-go <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss">weight loss</a> snack combos. Looking to get in on the trend? We’ve rounded up some of the most delicious-looking bento boxes on Instagram to help fuel your lunchtime inspiration:</p><h2 id="protein-produce-bento-box">PROTEIN & PRODUCE BENTO BOX</h2><p/><blockquote style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-version="4" class="instagram-media"><div style="padding:8px;"> <div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"> <div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"/></div><p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"><a target="_top" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" href="https://instagram.com/p/6LG6QzBqIG/">A photo posted by Stevie (@stevielee86)</a> on <time datetime="2015-08-09T18:59:55+00:00" style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;">Aug 9, 2015 at 11:59am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote><p/><script src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js" defer="" async=""/><p>This protein-filled lunchbox features Applegate Farms turkey, raw nuts, cucumber slices, grapes, celery and <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/16-best-nut-butters">almond butter</a> for dunking.

So clean out those crisper drawers and starting filling your freezer with these foods that support <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss">weight loss</a> and can help you whip up a healthy meal in no time.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">1</div><div class="title">Vegetables</div></div></div><p><img alt="frozen vegetables best weight loss foods" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/392315746/frozen-veggies.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>The days of finding a rotten half head of lettuce at the back of your fridge can be a thing of the past — if you get to know the frozen foods section of your local supermarket. And don’t you dare feel bad for skipping the produce section in front; frozen veggies retain more nutrients than their fresh-sold counterparts because “the frozen ones are picked then immediately (or soon after) frozen,” according to Isabel Smith, MS, RD, CDN, registered dietitian and founder of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.isabelsmithnutrition.com/">Isabel Smith Nutrition</a>. “Just read the labels on frozen packages to make sure there is no added sodium, sugar, or chemicals,” she advises. Plus, frozen veggies can be used on your own schedule — without fear of waste. Adding a handful of frozen spinach or other veggies to dishes here and there is a low-calorie, nutrient-dense way to boost satiety and <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/11-lazy-ways-to-lose-weight-fast">lose weight</a>. </p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Frozen vegetable medleys are an easy way to get more variety into your diet. Different colors of produce are natural indications that you’re getting different vitamins and minerals; the more colors you eat, the better. Next time you’re at the store, grab a bag of frozen tri-color bell peppers. Peppers are low-calorie and rich in vitamins A and C, which are important for healthy vision and vibrant, <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/healthy-foods-that-give-you-glowing-skin">glowing skin</a>. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">2</div><div class="title">Fruit</div></div></div><p><img alt="weight loss foods berries" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/941191764/frozen-berries.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>Think of the frozen packages as the better berries for your health — and budget. Fresh berries tend to be slightly more expensive than their frozen counterparts and are prone to growing mold quickly if they aren't prepped perfectly. Frozen fruit is also the perfect on-hand solution to squashing sweet cravings before they lead to a binge. Frozen mango is particularly good to have in the house; it boasts a sherbet-like consistency that can keep you from polishing off your pint of Ben & Jerry’s while delivering vital nutrients you’ll never find in the frozen dessert aisle.</p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Frozen versions of your favorite fruits are also killer for creating <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/how-to-make-perfect-weight-loss-smoothies">weight loss smoothies</a>. Plus, swapping out ice in favor of frozen fruit is an easy way to keep your shake from getting watered down. “Just make sure the bag does not have any added sugars, syrups and salts,” Smith cautions.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">3</div><div class="title">Grains</div></div></div><p><img alt="best weight loss foods quinoa" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/445893613/quinoa-salad-10-grains-weight-loss.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>A watched pot never boils — the saying feels especially true when you’re cooking grains. Sure, these <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-complex-carbohydrates-to-eat-for-weight-loss">complex carbs</a> provide stable, long-lasting energy and can be rich sources of essential protein, but the cook time can feel interminable. Trying to find a replacement in microwave meals or “instant” noodles can be tough, due to high sodium counts and other unhealthy additives in these foods. Luckily, the frozen section contains some clean, semi-cooked grain options for you to grab, heat and eat. “Rice and grains are a quick and healthy frozen option as long as you watch out for extra salt and other preservatives,” Smith says. “Stay away from anything that cannot be pronounced,” she warns.</p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Pre-cooked and pre-spiced wild rice or ancient grain blends make for diet-friendly sides or substitutes for meat dishes. You can also sprinkle these blends over a bed of salad for more texture and substance at lunch or dinner, which will fill you up with healthy, energy-boosting carbohydrates. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">4</div><div class="title">Fish</div></div></div><p><img alt="best weight loss foods salmon" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/514477319/salmon-veggies.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>You may not think of the freezer as the place to get your protein and <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/8-best-fats-for-weight-loss">healthy fat</a> fix, but it could be your best bet. Just like produce, lean protein like fish is often more nutrient-rich when found in the frozen section. “Some grocery stores sell their freshest wild or organic fish in the frozen section such as wild coho salmon, mahi and swordfish. Look for plain, frozen fish that doesn't come with a sauce, breading or other additives,” says Smith. The servings you’ll find in the freezer are often portioned appropriately too, she adds. </p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>When you’re looking at all the options in the frozen food aisles, choose wild fish when possible. Some farm-raised fish may have less nutritional value than wild due to the type of feed they’re given, particularly <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/shocking-facts-about-farmed-salmon">salmon</a> and <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/tilapia-is-worse-than-bacon">tilapia</a>.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">5</div><div class="title">Bread</div></div></div><p><img alt="best weight loss foods sprouted bread" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/820687478/sprouted-grain-bread-meat-free-proteins.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>Bread doesn’t have to be blacklisted from your diet. Healthy versions made from whole or <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/grains-with-as-many-health-benefits-as-quinoa">sprouted grains</a> are filled with fiber and protein to help round out your meals and delay hunger. But you won’t find the best ones in the bread aisle. “Often, gluten-free and other specialty loaves of bread are frozen to keep them fresh,” Smith explains. “Choose sprouted grains for more protein, and look for bread free of corn syrups and other common sweeteners. Also, aim for at least 3-4 grams of protein and 3-4 grams of fiber per serving,” she suggests.</p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Ezekial, a brand of sprouted grain bread, is a favorite of ours. Sprouting grains breaks down enzyme inhibitors, which helps your body better digest and absorb healthy nutrients from the bread.

Researchers have found that a diet high in fast food — and its essential components such as bad fats, sodium and sugar — can have far-ranging effects on your brain, your bones, your happiness and more. Here are seven things that you can look forward to when you finally give it up.</p><h2 id="your-jeans-fit-better-">Your jeans fit better.</h2><p>It’s no secret that fast food is packed with sodium, and you can easily consume most of your daily allowance in one meal. At McDonald’s, a Big Mac and medium fries contains 1,160 milligrams of sodium while a Quiznos regular Chicken Mesquite sub a has 2,280 milligrams — 50% and 100% of your recommended daily allowance respectively! The body copes with this influx of salt by holding on to water to maintain the proper sodium balance in the body. Welcome to <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/5-teas-banish-bloat">Bloat</a> Town. And eating too much sodium causes problems far beyond the aesthetic; read on.</p><h2 id="you-lower-your-risk-of-heart-disease-up-to-50-">You lower your risk of heart disease up to 50%.</h2><p>Eating fast food more than twice a week makes you 1.5 times more likely to develop <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/7-best-foods-decrease-heart-disease">heart disease</a> than people who infrequently or never eat it, a study published in the journal <em>Circulation</em> found. The high fat and sodium content of fast food is to blame. In fact, if Americans reduced their sodium intake, there would be 120,000 fewer cases of heart disease, 66,000 fewer strokes and 99,000 fewer heart attacks each year, according to the <em>British Medical Journal</em>.</p><h2 id="you-improve-your-memory-and-ability-to-learn-">You improve your memory and ability to learn.</h2><p>It’s not just years of relying on the fried fare of these restaurants that will affect your body, either. Rats who ate a diet of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-best-junk-food-choices-for-weight-loss">junk food</a> displayed memory loss and a lack of cognitive ability after just one week, according to a study published in the journal <em>Brain, Behavior, and Immunity</em>. And those effects extend to humans, too: Researchers from Oregon Health and Science University compared people’s blood levels of trans fats to their brain volume via MRI. They found that trans fats actually shrink your gray matter, replacing good fats in its membranes and affecting its ability to function. Yep, fast food can fry your brain.</p><h2 id="you-get-happier-">You get happier.</h2><p>Think a Whopper with cheese is comfort food? Think again. Eating fast food is associated with a higher rate of depression, and the risk gets higher the more fast food that’s eaten, a study published in the journal <em>Public Health Nutrition</em> found. The reason may lie in a separate study published in <em>Brain, Behavior and Immunity</em>: Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health found that women who ate a diet high in foods that trigger inflammation (such as soft drinks, <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/health-benefits-of-cutting-back-on-simple-carbohydrates">refined carbs</a>, red meat and margarine) had a 41% higher risk of depression over 12 years compared to women who ate a diet rich in inflammation busters like <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/8-best-fats-for-weight-loss">healthy fats</a>, vegetables, coffee and wine. So, alright, that black coffee from McCafe gets a pass.</p><h2 id="you-slash-your-risk-of-diabetes-">You slash your risk of diabetes.</h2><p>Eating a diet high in saturated and/or trans fats — hello, fast food! — can lead to insulin resistance, a condition in which the body releases more and more sugar into the blood. Over time, this can lead to <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/watching-this-new-movie-can-ward-off-weight-gain">weight gain</a> and a vastly increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.

And, as if negatively impacting your heart, brain and kidneys weren’t bad enough, some studies suggest sodium also affects your bones by competing in your body with calcium. Translation: the more sodium you take in, the more calcium you pee out. That can lead to bone demineralization and a decline in bone mass, which increases the risk of osteoporosis and breakage.</p><h2 id="you-have-more-energy-">You have more energy.</h2><p>Fast food is high in sugar, and it lurks in menu items that don’t sound remotely sweet. A McDonald's Crispy Chicken Sandwich contains 36 grams of sugars — 100% of the recommended daily allowance, or the equivalent of nine teaspoons! When you consume a high amount of refined sugar and <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/foods-make-you-hungrier">simple carbs</a>, the pancreas secretes insulin to keep your blood sugar low. Because fast food doesn’t contain enough complex carbs to give you lasting energy, your blood sugar levels crash soon after you finish eating, leaving you tired — and craving another quick hit of energy from more junky sugar and carbs.</p>]]</content:encoded></item><item><title>Supplements Diet Experts Swear By for Total Health</title><link>http://www.eatthis.com/supplements-diet-experts-swear-by-for-total-health</link><description>Find out which supplements nutritionists and dietitians rely on for total health, weight loss and decreased inflammation.</description><pubDate>2015-08-14T08:44:29.000Z</pubDate><guid>55cce7c7130000481c4d330c</guid><author>Eat This, Not That!</author><media:content url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/751036776/omega-3-fish-oil-supplement-xl.jpg type="image/jpeg"><media:thumbnail url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/751036776/omega-3-fish-oil-supplement-xl.jpg type="image/jpeg"><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="large-txt"><small><em>By Cecelia Smith</em></small></span></p><p><span class="large-txt">It’s time you know the truth: The pills you pop to improve your <a href="">total health</a> aren't always worth the cost.</span></p><p>In fact, some synthetic vitamins are downright dangerous — hyper dosed and full of creepy additives.

A form of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/6-flat-belly-foods-healthy-gut">‘good’ bacteria</a>, probiotics work to restore a healthy balance of microflora in the body by decreasing the ‘bad’ inflammatory bacteria in our guts, and replacing the ‘friendly’ bacteria that are often destroyed, like when we take antibiotics. I recommend shopping for a multi-strain variety that mimics the huge array of strains and species found naturally in the gut. Although you can also get probiotics from consuming fermented foods like kimchi, kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut and cultured vegetables, many people struggle with taking in these foods consistently.” — <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.foodconfidence.com/">Danielle Omar</a>, MS, RD, Integrative Dietitian</em></p><h2 id="nutritional-yeast">NUTRITIONAL YEAST</h2><p>“I am a big proponent of ‘food first, then supplements.’ With that in mind, I like to think of nutritional yeast—an inactive form of yeast grown on sugarcane and molasses that is sold as a food product—as a supplement. You’ll find nutritional yeast at health food stores (either in the baking, condiment, or supplement aisles). It comes in flaked or powdered form and has a unique ‘umami’ flavor that can best be compared to a nutty Parmesan cheese. It goes great with pasta, salads, stir-fries, soups, stews, dressings and dips. A 3-tablespoon serving provides well over a day’s worth of B vitamins, as well as 5 grams of fiber, 9 grams of protein and as much <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/high-potassium-foods-that-keep-your-muscles-healthy-and-strong">potassium</a> as a small banana. It's also an excellent source of zinc and selenium.

Even though it's called the 'sunshine vitamin,' most people can't count on the sun for enough, and it can be tough to get all you need from diet alone. In fact, vitamin D deficiency occurs in about 40% of the population worldwide. Low levels not only negatively affect bone health and the immune system but may also increase risk of inflammation, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, fatigue, dementia and mood disorders. The Vitamin D Council recommends 5,000 IUs of vitamin D3 per day for adults (and no more than 10,000 IUs/day), but you should work with your doctor to test your vitamin D levels before beginning supplementation to correct a deficiency, then follow up every 3 months to ensure you're at an optimal range. Remember, this a fat-soluble vitamin, so you'll want to take your D with a snack or meal that contains a few grams of fat." — <em><a target="_blank" href="http://claudiazapata.com/">Claudia Zapata</a>, MS, RD</em></p><h2 id="apple-cider-vinegar">APPLE CIDER VINEGAR</h2><p>“I love raw <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/how-good-apple-cider-vinegar">apple cider vinegar</a> and recommend it to our Foodtrainers’ clients for improved <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss">weight loss</a> results. ACV is rich in a compound called acetic acid that has proven to speed up fat burning by interfering with the body’s ability to digest starch. It also helps regulate the appetite by keeping blood sugar nice and steady and warding off spikes associated with weight gain. I recommend starting every day with an ACV tonic: 1 tablespoon diluted in a glass of water; you can take it again before dinner if you’d like. Make sure to buy raw ACV, which should appear cloudy — a sign that the vinegar is mature and rich in good-for-you bacteria. We like Vermont Organic Farm’s apple cider vinegar from Dwight Miller & Son Orchards for its superior taste and quality, and use it exclusively in our offices.” — <em><a target="_blank" href="http://foodtrainers.com/">Lauren Slayton</a> MS, RD, Author of</em> The Little Book of Thin</p><p><img alt="fish oil supplements for total health" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/751036776/omega-3-fish-oil-supplement.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><h2 id="fish-oil">FISH OIL</h2><p>“Fish oil is one supplement I believe everyone would benefit from, and my whole family — including our 3- and 6-year-old girls — take it daily. Research supports the widespread benefits of high-quality fish oil that span basically every cell in your body, including your heart, brain and skin. Unfortunately, the best sources of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/ask-etnt-omega-3s">omega-3</a> — an essential fat that people need to get from their diets — aren't common in a Western Diet. Research also suggests that even people who regularly eat natural sources, like fish, would benefit from higher doses. You want to aim for at least 1,000 mg of EPA and DHA combined (those are both types of omega-3 fats), and the key is using a brand that's molecularly distilled (it will tell you this on the product itself), doesn't smell or taste fishy (you'd find that out real quick) and has a reputation for being trustworthy. I use, like, trust, recommend and have partnered with Nordic Naturals; it's what we use in our house and is the industry leader.” — <em><a target="_blank" href="http://mohrresults.com/">Christopher R.

But if you don’t have a perfect diet (and let’s face it, how many of us do?), including a high-quality multivitamin as part of your daily routine is an easy way to fill the nutritional gaps necessary for your individual health needs. Don’t let the options overwhelm you. If you spend some time reading the labels, you can find a multivitamin perfectly tailored to your health challenges and goals. For example, if a client came to me with symptoms of chronic fatigue and tummy trouble, I would suggest New Chapter Perfect Calm Multivitamin — or another brand with a mix of nutrients proven to help regulate energy levels and digestion. I recommend whole food vitamins for their digestibility, over synthetic products that derive their ‘nutrition’ from chemicals.

Adding a scoop of high-quality protein to a smoothie, strained <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/9-best-yogurt-brands-to-eat-for-weight-loss">yogurt</a> or bowl of oatmeal is an easy way to start the day with a powerful punch of satiating protein that—unlike a high-starch meal like a bagel—can help steady your blood sugar and keep your hands out of the snack drawer until lunch. When shopping for a protein powder, read the ingredients label for artificial flavorings, colors and sneaky added sugars under all of their possible names (not naturally occurring). Most importantly, look at the serving size (how many tablespoons or scoops) compared to the protein content. Don't be wooed by the one that seems to have more protein but also requires more powder.” — <em><a target="_blank" href="http://healthfullyeverafter.co">Carlene Thomas</a> RDN, LD</em> </p><h2 id="magnesium">MAGNESIUM</h2><p>“I take 250 mg of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-foods-to-eat-for-magnesium">magnesium</a> daily to prevent headaches, and it’s especially effective for people who suffer from more severe migraines. Often forgotten, magnesium is an essential mineral that every organ in our body needs — and most people are not meeting the recommended daily intake. Luckily, serious deficiencies are rare since the mineral can be found a variety of common healthy foods, like green leafy vegetables, unrefined grains, meat and nuts. Since research suggests that magnesium may also decrease inflammation and help regulate blood sugar levels, it’s worth talking with your doctor about a supplement that will help you meet the recommended amount.” — <em><a target="_blank" href="http://lorizanini.com/">Lori Zanini</a>, RD, CDE, Spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</em></p><p><br/><br/><strong><a target="_blank

If you say, “Yeah, that ain’t gonna happen,” that’s understandable. (And you don’t necessarily have to, if you opt for one of the <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/14-best-light-beers-in-america">Best Light Beers in America</a>).</span></p><p>The second best way to get rid of your beer belly: Lower your body fat so your abs can emerge to greet the day. But you know that already. We’re all about finding the best ways to <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/6-easy-ways-burn-fat">burn fat</a> and stay lean with a smart diet that avoids deprivation. Likewise, there are better ways to shred your midsection than spending hours on the treadmill or doing basic crunches.</p><p>We asked 7 top personal trainers — spanning the worlds of cycling, CrossFit, yoga and beyond — for their favorite exercises that’ll give anyone a head start on whittling their middle. Here are 16 of their recommendations.</p><h2 id="-a-href-http-sandmanfitness-com-target-_blank-eric-sand-a-national-academy-of-sports-medicine-certified-personal-trainer-and-lead-instructor-at-bespoke-premium-cycling-studio-in-downtown-los-angeles"><a target="_blank" href="http://sandmanfitness.com">ERIC SAND</a>, National Academy of Sports Medicine Certified Personal Trainer and lead instructor at Bespoke Premium Cycling Studio in downtown Los Angeles</h2><h3 id="-bicycle-crunches-"><strong>Bicycle Crunches</strong></h3><p><strong>Why they’re great for your belly:</strong> The bicycle exercise was proven to stimulate more abdominal activity in the rectus abdominus (aka your <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/lose-belly-fat-and-get-6-pack-abs-with-these-foods">six-pack</a>) and the inner and outer obliques than the traditional crunch, in studies using electromyography, a fancy word for technique-that-measures-muscular activity.</p><p><strong>How to do them:</strong> Lie flat on a mat. Bring your knees up to 90-degree angle, and take your hands behind your head (applying as little pressure to the neck as possible). Lift the upper body and rotate across the body while simultaneously performing a bicycle motion with your legs, drawing the opposite armpit toward the opposite knee. Try to keep the elbows as open as possible, and draw the core in and up as much as possible. Perform 12-15 reps (one to the right, one to the left counts as ONE rep) for 2-3 sets.</p><p><img alt="best exercises for beer belly leg raises" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/684595641/best-exercises-beer-belly-leg-raises.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><h3 id="-hanging-leg-raises-"><strong>Hanging Leg Raises</strong></h3><p><strong>Why they’re great for your belly:</strong> The hanging leg raise targets the transverse abdominus (the front and side of the abdominal walls located below your internal obliques), which is a significant part of achieving core strength.</p><p><strong>How to do them:</strong> Find a pull-up bar. While holding yourself up (pulling the shoulders down and back as much as possible), keep your feet together and exhale to bend the knees and pull them up to just above a 90-degree angle. Pause for a second at the top, and slowly lower the legs back to the hanging position. For an added challenge, perform the leg raises with straight legs (pointing the toes away from you) and add in a twist to the right and left (alternating on each rep) to hit not only the transverse abs but also the internal obliques. To stimulate the heart rate even more, perform a pull-up between each hanging leg raise. Be sure not to swing the legs and to stay in control of the motion! Perform 3 sets of 10-12 raises.</p><h3 id="-stability-ball-mountain-climber-"><strong>Stability Ball Mountain Climber</strong></h3><p><strong>Why it's great for your belly:</strong> The pushup-plank position will help stabilize the core, while the mountain climbers will help develop hip flexion.</p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Place your hands a foot-and-a-half apart on a large stability ball (in a pushup position). Be sure the body is in a straight line from head to toe. Slowly bring the right foot off the floor and pull the right knee up towards the chest. Pause at the top, then slowly lower back to the floor and repeat on the opposite side. For an added bonus, perform a pushup on the stability ball between each rep. The mountain climbers should be slow and controlled. Perform 2-3 sets of 10-12 per side.</p><h3 id="-incline-reverse-crunch-"><strong>Incline Reverse Crunch</strong></h3><p><strong>Why it's great for your belly:</strong> The reverse crunch is an easy exercise to continually progress in order to challenge the rectus abdominus. The higher the incline, the higher the resistance (and this is also a great exercise to do if the pullup-position of the hanging leg raise is too difficult for you)</p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Find an adjustable incline bench. Set the incline to approximately 45 degrees (the flatter the incline, the easier the exercise becomes, so beginners can start with the bench completely flat). Place your head at the top of the incline and legs at the bottom, knees bent. Grabbing the bench behind your head, slowly exhale as you pull your knees up towards your head, rolling up one vertebra at a time. Pause at the top, and then slowly control the core (keep pulling it in an up!) as you lower back down to the bottom of the bench, articulating one vertebra at a time into the bench. Perform 3 sets of 10-12 reps.</p><h2 id="deborah-warner-president-a-href-http-www-milehighrunclub-com-target-_blank-mile-high-run-club-a-">DEBORAH WARNER, President, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.milehighrunclub.com">Mile High Run Club</a></h2><h3 id="-russian-twist-with-a-kettlebell-"><strong>Russian Twist With a Kettlebell</strong></h3><p><strong>Why it’s great for your belly:</strong> The Russian twist with a kettlebell targets upper and lower abdominals and the obliques. </p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit on the floor with your legs bent. Hold a kettlebell in front of you. Twist as far as you can to the left, then twist as far as you can to the right. This can be executed at a higher intensity with a heavier kettlebell for more calorie burn. Bicycle the legs for an extra challenge! You should perform 3 to 6 sets for 30 seconds each, with a 30-second break in between. </p><h2 id="andre-crews-trainer-at-a-href-http-crossfitunionsquare-com-target-_blank-crossfit-union-square-a-new-york-city">ANDRE CREWS, Trainer at <a target="_blank" href="http://crossfitunionsquare.com">CrossFit Union Square</a>, New York City</h2><p><img alt="best exercises for beer belly deadlift" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/972376015/best-exercises-beer-belly-deadlifts.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><h3 id="-deadlift-"><strong>Deadlift</strong></h3><p><strong>Why it’s great for your belly:</strong> Deadlifts are a gym session must because they essentially work everything south of your neck: Traps, lats, pecs, abs, glutes, quads—the list goes on. It’s the most fundamental movement in the history of man. By building a solid foundation of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/easy-tweak-builds-more-muscle">lean muscle</a> mass, your body will burn more fat while at rest. </p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> This one’s a must to do right, so learn the basics in this article from our friends at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shape.com/fitness/workouts/one-exercise-every-woman-should-do">Shape</a> and find some strength-building variations from our partners at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mensfitness.com/training/build-muscle/deadlift">Men’s Fitness</a>.</p><h3 id="-run-faster-run-again-faster-"><strong>Run. Faster. Run Again. Faster.</strong></h3><p><strong>Why it’s great for your belly:</strong> Look at the body of an Olympic sprinter compared to a marathon runner. You'll notice some not-so-subtle differences. Both have impressive cardiovascular systems, but the sprinter has a more impressive physique. And it's not because sprinters lift weights and do crunches all day. When you sprint, you activate your fast-twitch muscles, which help you lift heavy and move explosively. So when we sprint, we light those muscles up all throughout your body. Your obliques will fire up as your core works to maintain stability.</p><h2 id="-a-href-https-www-facebook-com-andymcdermottfitness-_rdr-p-target-_blank-andy-mcdermott-a-hollywood-fitness-trainer"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AndyMcDermottFitness?_rdr=p">ANDY McDERMOTT</a>, Hollywood fitness trainer</h2><h3 id="-hand-walkouts-"><strong>Hand Walkouts</strong></h3><p><strong>Why they’re great for your belly:</strong> These are one of my favorite core exercises. I love this movement because it incorporates flexibility and mobility into the core strengthening and stabilization. You're activating so many muscles groups in your "machine" that you don't need to do too many before you're feeling it big time. </p><p><strong>How to do them:</strong> From a standing position, bend at the waist and place your palms on the ground in front of your feet (bend your knees a bit if needed). Slowly "walk" your hands out away from your feet as far as you can. After pausing for a beat, slowly walk your feet forward until they reach your hands, then stand up. Repeat. (Or watch <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AndyMcDermottFitness/videos/vb.189966197779301/560510587391525/?type=2&theater">this video</a> on how to do them.)</p><p><img alt="best exercises for beer belly x pushup" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/960950250/best-exercises-beer-belly-x-pushup.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><h3 id="-x-push-ups-"><strong>X Push-Ups</strong></h3><p><strong>Why they’re great for your belly:</strong> This incorporates your whole body. I believe our body responds better when we train it as a complete unit—not one part at a time. In this exercise there's an element of proprioception (basically, throwing your body off balance), which forces your core muscles to activate — fighting to keep you stabilized. </p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Push up, then rotate one hand off the ground and point to the sky. After stabilizing in a "T," raise the top leg and point it to the sky also, forming an "X" with your body. After pausing for a beat, lower your leg, then lower your hand down, repeat with a push up and the other side of your body. (Or watch <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AndyMcDermottFitness/videos/vb.189966197779301/700414246734491/?type=2&theater">this video</a> on how to do them.)</p><h2 id="dean-pohlman-founder-a-href-http-manflowyoga-com-target-_blank-man-flow-yoga-a-">DEAN POHLMAN, Founder, <a target="_blank" href="http://manflowyoga.com">Man Flow Yoga</a></h2><p><img alt="best exercises beer belly high lunge" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/996013962/best-exercises-beer-belly-high-lunge.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><h3 id="-high-lunge-"><strong>High Lunge</strong></h3><p><strong>Why it’s great for your belly:</strong> The High Lunge is a full-body exercise that works on endurance, strength and flexibility in your lower body, balance and core strength, in addition to helping to open the chest. This position puts your body in full alert mode, which speeds up your <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/6-ways-to-boost-your-metabolism">metabolism</a> and helps you burn fat faster.</p><p><img alt="best exercises for beer belly warrior 3" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/933238542/best-exercises-beer-belly-warrior-3.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><h3 id="-warrior-3-"><strong>Warrior 3 </strong></h3><p><strong>Why it's great for your belly:</strong> Similar to High Lunge, this is a full-body exercise that requires you to be extremely attentive to detail. It is a very challenging pose that can leave you gasping for air in just seconds if it’s attempted correctly and at maximum effort. This pose will tax your core strength, balance and flexibility, and push your maximum range of motion in your chest and shoulders.</p><h2 id="brian-flynn-owner-of-a-href-http-bodyuniquept-com-target-_blank-body-unique-a-in-brooklyn-new-york-named-one-of-nyc-s-best-trainers-by-the-new-york-post-">BRIAN FLYNN, Owner of <a target="_blank" href="http://bodyuniquept.com">Body Unique</a> in Brooklyn, New York; named one of NYC’s best trainers by the <em>New York Post</em></h2><p>At Body Unique, we rarely if ever use crunches. Most of our clients come into us with posture issues, hunched over from long days of work and with sunken shoulders. So when we’re programming core movements, we try to open our clients up with stretching and activation activities, bringing them back into alignment (which is a core exercise in itself), and then we torch the core with some basic and super-effective moves.</p><p><img alt="best exercises for beer belly low plank" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/702900393/best-exercises-beer-belly-low-plank.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><h3 id="-low-plank-"><strong>Low Plank</strong></h3><p><strong>Why it’s great for your belly:</strong> I absolutely love this exercise because it creates a lot of stability around the entire core (front/back), it helps support the spine better because you are activating the entire back side of your body while engaging your core on the front side. This helps you run a lower risk of back pain. It's also a fantastic exercise to help slim down your waistline.</p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Set your forearms on the floor with elbows directly under your shoulders and legs fully extended behind you, with your knees locked out. The trick to this exercise is to be as parallel to the ground as possible, so try not let your hips drop or your head push toward the ground. The more aligned you are, the more effective it is. Draw your navel in, squeeze your butt and try to pull your elbows toward your feet (this will engage your lats). If you are doing this exercise properly you will probably only be able to hold it for 20 seconds. That's OK—put your knees back down on the ground with your forearms in place, rest for a few seconds and have at another rep.  </p><h3 id="-sitting-medicine-ball-anti-rotations-"><strong>Sitting Medicine Ball Anti-Rotations</strong></h3><p><strong>Why it’s great for your belly:</strong> This creates stability around the midsection, links up the upper and lower body through the core and wakes up your obliques.</p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit down and hold a light medicine ball. Sit up, feet hip width apart, with your chest upright. With your navel drawn in, bring the medicine ball to chest height with elbows tight to your sides and shoulders down. Then press the ball straight out in front of you. Keeping your shoulders through your feet still and your arms extended, bring the ball from side to side, ending in front of each shoulder. To make this movement more challenging, move a little faster.</p><p><img alt="best exercises for beer belly stability ball pikes" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/107125658/best-exercises-beer-belly-stability-ball-pike.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><h3 id="-stability-ball-roll-outs-with-pull-in-"><strong>Stability Ball Roll Outs with Pull-In</strong></h3><p><strong>Why it’s great for your belly:</strong> This is a combination movement that involves the entire core as well as your upper and lower body, which increases calorie burning. And it’s fun!</p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Set yourself up with your hands on the floor directly under your shoulders and your shins on a stability ball. Get as stable as you possibly can, with your navel drawn in, before moving to the next step. Drive your body back while keeping your hands in place, so the stability ball ends up around your thighs, your hands overhead and chest dropping towards the floor slightly. Get stable in this position so pause for a moment (you will feel this in your triceps, shoulders and lats). The next step is to go in the opposite direction. Move toward your initial position with your hands directly under your shoulders and hips pushing forward into a pike position toward the ceiling, with your legs bent. Then go back into starting position and repeat. </p><h3 id="-kettlebell-overhead-walking-"><strong>Kettlebell Overhead Walking</strong></h3><p><strong>Why it’s great for your belly:</strong> This is a fantastic way to integrate the strength you gained with the previous movements. You’ll increase your calorie burn because it’s strength training and uses the entire body. </p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> This exercise can be done with a dumbbells, kettlebells, weight plate, sandbag or any other weighted implement. Find a weight that you can hold above your head with your elbows extended without hyperextending your lower back. Bring it overhead and pack your shoulders down in the socket (this will help with stability). Try to keep your rib cage down and navel drawn in. (For safety purposes, start slow!) Walk slowly while remaining stable. The weight will want to drift back so you will need to stay as stiff as possible. Once you feel comfortable, you can take larger steps. </p><h2 id="sean-wells-owner-and-pt-a-href-http-naplespersonaltraining-com-target-_blank-naples-personal-training-llc-a-">SEAN WELLS, Owner and PT, <a target="_blank" href="http://naplespersonaltraining.com">Naples Personal Training, LLC</a></h2><h3 id="-weight-lifting-with-cardio-"><strong>Weight Lifting With Cardio</strong></h3><p><strong>Why it’s great for your belly:</strong> Research shows that a program consisting of both resistance training and cardiovascular exercise, along with nutritional modifications, is the ideal <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss">weight-loss</a> method. </p><p><strong>How to do it:</strong> The resistance-training program should focus on moderate resistance with moderate sets and reps (2 to 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps), with a focus on functional movements that engage more than one part of the body (such as squats, rowing and chopping motions). Be sure to work different body regions back to back, with little rest between movements.

And it’s not just because you’re young. It’s because of the powers and prevalence today of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/5-best-teas-that-boost-your-calorie-burn">green tea</a>.</span></p><p>Sales of green tea have exploded by 60 percent in just the last 10 years, primarily because of millennials, according to a new report by the Tea Association of the U.S.A. In fact, tea sales totaled $1.8 billion in 1990; by 2020 they will reach $47 billion. And what’s good for Bigelow’s budget is good for your abs, as well. Because green tea may be the most potent fat-burning weapon known to man—all for just 11 cents a cup.</p><p>Taiwanese researchers studied more than 1,100 people over an 10-year period and found that those who drank green tea had nearly 20 percent less body fat than those who drank none. And in a Swedish study, those who drank green tea instead of water with their meals reported less hunger, even two hours later. The secret is a <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/6-ways-to-boost-your-metabolism">metabolism</a>-boosting nutrient called EGCG, found almost exclusively in green tea, which has been shown to simultaneously enhance lipolysis (the breakdown of fat) and block adipogenesis (the formation of fat cells). Here are 7 ways to maximize green tea’s effects on your belly fat, and to build abs that show faster than ever, compliments of new research from <em>Eat This, Not That!</em>’s latest book, The 7-Day Flat-Belly Tea Cleanse.</p><h2 id="green-tea-abs-secret-1">Green Tea Abs Secret #1</h2><p>Drink it before and after your workout. In one study, participants who combined a daily habit of 4-5 cups of green tea each day with a 25-minute workout lost an average of 2 pounds more than those who did the same workout, but without the green tea.</p><h2 id="green-tea-abs-secret-2">Green Tea Abs Secret #2</h2><p>Get your matcha on. Matcha is a form of green tea that uses the entire leaf in powdered form, rather than flakes of leaves. Some studies have shown the concentration of EGCG in matcha to be as much as 137 times greater than what you’ll find in store-bought tea bags. One study found men who drank green tea containing 136 mg of EGCG—what you’ll find in a single 4-gram serving of matcha—lost twice as much weight and four times as much belly fat over 3 months than a placebo group. Try it in these <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/healthy-recipes-using-matcha-green-tea">8 Fat-Blasting Recipes Using Matcha</a>!</p><h2 id="green-tea-abs-secret-3">Green Tea Abs Secret #3</h2><p>Squeeze in some lemon. When you sip tea, a significant percentage of the polyphenol antioxidants break down before they reach your bloodstream. But researchers at Purdue University discovered that adding lemon juice to the equation helped preserve the polyphenols. </p><h2 id="green-tea-abs-secret-4">Green Tea Abs Secret #4</h2><p>Ditch the dairy. A study in the <em>European Heart Journal</em> found that while tea can improve blood flow and blood vessel dilation (and thereby lower your blood pressure), adding milk to the tea counteracts these effects. </p><h2 id="green-tea-abs-secret-5">Green Tea Abs Secret #5</h2><p>Make a green tea smoothie. Either blend matcha into your favorite recipe, or use brewed green tea as your liquid base. Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine found that dieters who drank 8 ounces of plant-based juices a day over a twelve-week period lost, on average, 4 pounds more than dieters following the exact same plan, but without the drinks.

According to a study review in the <em>International Journal of Molecular Science</em>, <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/ask-etnt-omega-3s">omega-3</a> polyunsaturated fatty acids like those found in fish may enhance not only the bioavailability of EGCG, but also its effectiveness. </p><h2 id="green-tea-abs-secret-7">Green Tea Abs Secret #7</h2><p>Make sure you get enough protein. Eating enough protein is critical to helping EGCG do its job. Studies show that those who have low levels of serum albumin—a type of protein found in the blood—also have lower levels of EGCG. Albumin is essential for moving fluids and nutrients between the blood stream and the body tissues. Eating enough lean protein is the key to keeping those blood albumin levels up.</p><p><br/><br/>To learn more about the wonders of tea, and get started on a 7-day plan that will melt up to 10 pounds, buy the <em>7-Day Flat-Belly Tea Cleanse</em> now, exclusively in e-Book format.

In fact, quite the opposite is true. When <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-protein-shake-recipes-weight-loss">protein shakes</a>, bars and other sports supplements become a cornerstone of your diet, that usually means whole foods are being neglected. Ignoring these natural sources of nutrients can not only slow weight loss progress but also potentially cause serious health problems. </p><p>Unfortunately, the issue is more common that you think: 20 percent of men fess up to replacing meals with dietary supplements that aren’t intended to be eaten in place of real food, a recent survey found. What’s more, 40 percent of survey respondents said their use of the supplements was increasing, and 30 percent admitted to having concerns about their own supplement use. Ladies are guilty of overloading on supps, too. Less recent surveys of both men and women suggest that up to 75 percent of American adults are "regular users" of dietary supplements.</p><div data-edit-number="0" class="module-edit"><div class="quote-mod2"><div class="open-quote">“</div><div class="quote">20% of men admit to replacing meals with dietary supplements that aren’t intended to be eaten in place of real food.</div></div></div><p>“Supplements and protein products shouldn’t make up the bulk of your calories,” says Martha McKittrick, RD CDE, the expert we asked to explain how much supplement use is considered healthy. “They should be part of a balanced, whole food diet,” she adds. “Since shakes and bars often don't have as much fiber or volume as natural foods, they don’t make us feel as full. This can make it more challenging to lose weight. What’s more, many products contain artificial sweeteners that can increase cravings for sweets,” McKittrick explains.</p><p>Both she and Isabel Smith, RD, CDN suggest consuming no more than two sports supplements a day — a protein shake after working out and a protein bar for a mid-afternoon snack is acceptable. But you need to read labels closely. Avoid anything with potentially harmful additives like artificial colors or sweeteners, <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/foods-make-you-hungrier">high fructose corn syrup</a>, fat burners or energy boosters. “Your go-tos should only include ingredients that you can read and pronounce,” says Smith. Her suggestion: “Look for products with less than 10 grams of sugar per serving that also provide at least 4 grams each of protein and fiber.”</p>]]</content:encoded></item><item><title>Get in the Mood and Have Better Sex with These Healthy Foods</title><link>http://www.eatthis.com/get-in-the-mood-have-better-sex-healthy-foods</link><description>Find out how to get in the mood for sex.

In fact, nearly every first date revolves around food, according to a survey by mobile dating app Clover.</span></p><p>Recently released scientific findings show that we’re far more interested in romance and sex after we’ve enjoyed a good meal. (Apparently, a rumbling stomach doesn’t put people in the mood.) But if you really want to rev your sexual appetite, don’t just idly nosh. Instead, reach for foods shown to enhance desire and pleasure. </p><p>By increasing blood flow and energy levels, the healthy <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-best-foods-rapid-weight-loss">weight loss foods</a> below will heighten your arousal, sex drive and pleasure—so much so that you may even want to go for a second round!

Although that may not sound sexy, you’re sure to enjoy the effects. “Increased blood flow drives blood to the extremities, which, like Viagra, can increase arousal and make sex more pleasurable,” says psychotherapist and sex expert <a target="_blank" href="http://www.drtammynelson.com/">Tammy Nelson Ph.D.</a> “Women will find it is easier to have an orgasm, and men will find that erections come more naturally. Having good sex is the best aphrodisiac. It makes you want to have more sex,” she adds.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">2</div><div class="title">GREEN <br/>TEA</div></div></div><p><img alt="healthy foods for better sex grean tea" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/800864961/green-tea-8-perfect-fitness-foods.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>If you’re a big <em>Eat This, Not That!</em> fan, you already know that we’re big fans of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/how-to-make-the-perfect-cup-of-green-tea-for-weight-loss">green tea</a>—and for good reason. The brew is rich in compounds called catechins, which have been shown to blast away <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-daily-habits-blast-belly-fat">belly fat</a> and speed the liver’s capacity for turning fat into energy. But that’s not all: Catechins also boost desire by promoting blood flow to your nether region. “Catechins kill off free radicals that damage and inflame blood vessels, increasing their ability to transport blood,” says Bjork. “Catechins also cause blood vessel cells to release nitric oxide, which increases the size of the blood vessels, leading to improved blood flow,” she explains. Blood flow to the genitals = feeling of sexual excitement, so sipping the stuff will, well, make you want to get it on. Bjork suggests drinking four cups a day to feel the full effects.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">3</div><div class="title">RED <br/> WINE</div></div></div><p><img alt="healthy foods for better sex wine" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/148929358/red-wine-youre-going-to-love-what-science-says-boosts-immunity.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>If you’re looking for a way to simultaneously boost your libido and calm those pre-date jitters, pour yourself a glass of red <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/16-wines-for-weight-loss">wine</a>. Women who drank one to two glasses of the stuff had heightened sexual desire compared to ladies who didn’t down any vino, a <em>Journal of Sexual Medicine</em> study found. Just be sure to cut yourself after your second glass; enjoying more than that didn’t stimulate any further arousal, and knocking back too much can put a damper on your sexual performance and pleasure. What makes the elixir so beneficial is a rich antioxidant profile that triggers nitric oxide production in the blood, which relaxes artery walls. This increases blood flow down south, creating feelings of sexual excitement.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">4</div><div class="title">FATTY<br/>FISH</div></div></div><p><img alt="healthy foods for better sex salmon" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/581980696/atlantic-salmon.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>It’s no secret that oily coldwater fish like wild salmon, sardines, and tuna are overflowing with omega-3 fatty acids, but here’s something you may not know: The nutrient not only benefits your heart but also raises dopamine levels in the brain. This spike in dopamine improves circulation and blood flow, triggering arousal, Bjork and Nelson explain. There’s more: “Dopamine will make you feel more relaxed and connected to your partner, which makes sex more fun,” adds Nelson. </p><p>Sounds like a great reason to order the fish to us—just make sure it’s not one that fish that causes <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/types-of-fish-that-cause-belly-fat">belly fat</a>. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">5</div><div class="title">STEAK &<br/> BURGERS</div></div></div><p><img alt="healthy foods for better sex steak" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/992914271/outback-steakhouse-filet-mignon.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><p>If your crazy busy schedule is to blame for your lack of libido, you’re not alone. “One of the primary reasons couples stop having sex is because they’re tired, fatigued and <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/5-foods-fight-stress">stressed</a>. But sometimes, there’s a biological component at play,” says Nelson. One of the causes of fatigue in women is iron deficiency. The condition can zap energy, which may result in a low sex drive, explains Nelson. Bjork concurs, adding, “Iron deficiency is common and can result in feelings of exhaustion, weakness and irritability, which doesn't make anyone feel like getting intimate.”</p><p>Bjork says remedying the situation requires a two-part approach: “If you think your diet lacks iron, focus on eating more spinach, grass-fed <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/meats-that-burn-fat">red meat</a> and liver, all foods rich in the nutrient. Then, ensure sure your body is able to utilize the iron,” she says. “Consuming probiotic-rich yogurt, fatty fish and an L-glutamine supplement can improve gut health and help your body to absorb iron more efficiently,” explains Bjork.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">6</div><div class="title">DARK <br/> CHOCOLATE</div></div></div><p><img alt="healthy foods for better sex dark chocolate" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/847730306/dark-chocolate-11-foods-end-bad-moods.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>Good news, chocolate lovers: Your go-to indulgence can help get you in the mood. Dark chocolate contains flavonoids that have been shown to reduce stress and relax blood vessels, sending blood to all the right regions—no Twinkie can claim that.

It's unclear whether the cost of the burger with increase, but for now, you’re likely getting more meat for your money. Unfortunately, this money-saving meat increase is costing your waistline 30 extra calories.</p><p>But if you want to enjoy the bigger burger, there are some easy ways you can save calories to ensure it won’t derail your weight loss efforts: Hold the ketchup to save 20 calories or axe the cheese to cut 100. If you're getting an order of fries with your meal, size down. If you opt for a small over a medium, for example, you'll save 110 calories, which more than makes up for the additional calories in the beefed-up burger. Another option: Create a custom Quarter-Pounder using the <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/we-tried-it-mcdonalds-create-your-taste-kiosks">Create Your Taste</a> kiosk and opt for a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.

But for <a target="_blank" href="http://chrispowell.com/">Chris Powell</a>, the trainer who has helped hundreds of overweight people lose up to half their body weight on ABC’s reality series <em>Extreme Weight Loss</em>, this is an everyday challenge—and one at which he excels. Thanks to his vast arsenal of smart <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss">weight loss</a> tricks, Powell helped the 15 participants who completed last season’s show shed a total of 2,476 pounds.</p><p>Though anyone can tune into the show and take away some of Powell’s slim down tips, not every aspect of the transformation process is shown on TV. That means some of his best tactics are only known by a select few—until now. We checked in with Powell and asked him to spill some behind-the-scene slim down secrets that have helped contestants lose hundreds of pounds — and how the rest of us can use them at home. Read on to get in the know and be sure to incorporate some Powell’s tips into your own <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/14-ways-lose-your-belly-14-days">flat-belly</a> plan.</p><h2 id="they-guzzle-water-by-the-gallon">They Guzzle Water By the Gallon</h2><p>You’ve likely heard that you should drink eight cups of water daily, which is a whopping half-gallon. If you thought downing that much fluid would send you running to the bathroom far too often, consider this: Extreme Weight Loss contestants drink more than double that amount every day. "You don't see it on the show, but our contestants drink a lot of water—at least a gallon every day as a baseline. Then, they drink an extra 32 ounces for every hour they exercise,” says Powell. “Not only does this slightly increase their metabolism, but it also keeps them full between meals and wards off bouts of overeating. This strategy plays a key role in their extraordinary success!” he explains. </p><h2 id="they-have-carb-curfews">They Have Carb Curfews</h2><p>Though starchy and sugary carbs—like <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/7-fat-burning-ways-cook-with-quinoa">quinoa</a>, potatoes and fruit— aren’t totally off limits, participants never consume them after dark. “For dinner, contestants always have a high-protein, high-fat meal with plenty of fibrous veggies,” Powell tells us. “If they have a post-dinner snack, they stick to protein-rich, high-fat foods like almonds or 2% milk-fat string cheese,” he explains. This is because, he adds, axing carbs at night flips the fat burning switch by increasing the amount of fat burning hormones released while we’re asleep.  </p><h2 id="they-keep-their-eyes-on-the-prize-literally">They Keep Their Eyes on the Prize—Literally</h2><p>“When people are in the middle of the grind—working out hard and dieting—they often forget why they’re doing it and just focus on the sacrifices they’re making. This makes it hard to keep going,” explains Powell. “To counteract that, we revisit each person’s <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/7-ways-to-think-yourself-thin">motivation</a> to lose weight throughout their weight loss journey and put a visual to it. We’ll pull pictures their kids, an aspirational body type, even copies of their medical records,” says Powell. </p><p>To employ this tactic at home, put visuals reminder of your weight loss motivator on the refrigerator, bathroom mirror, car dashboard or set the image as your cell phone background. Doing so will remind you that you’re working toward something that will improve your happiness and quality of life, according to Powell.</p><p/><blockquote style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-version="4" class="instagram-media"><div style="padding:8px;"> <div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"> <div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"/></div><p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"><a target="_top" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" href="https://instagram.com/p/qzGBRhG_Ph/">A photo posted by Extreme Weight Loss (@extweightloss)</a> on <time datetime="2014-07-23T15:19:27+00:00" style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;">Jul 23, 2014 at 8:19am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote><p/><script src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js" defer="" async=""/><h2 id="meal-prep-is-everything">Meal Prep Is Everything</h2><p>We asked Chris to tell us his number one diet tip. His response: Basically, <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/meal-prep-ideas-for-every-weight-loss-diet">meal prep</a> is everything. “Prep your meals in advance, and always have ready-to-eat <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/25-best-protein-snacks">healthy snack foods</a> with you,” he suggests. Chris and his Extreme Weight Loss participants bulk-prep their proteins (chicken, turkey, fish) and starches (potatoes, whole-wheat rice and noodles) every four days and store them in plastic containers. This prep allows them to grab healthy eats quickly before they leave the house. “We always carry <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-protein-powder-every-goal">protein powder</a> with us,” he says about snacks, adding, “You’ll never catch us without almonds in our bags! They’re filled with healthy, satiating fats and protein and don’t need to be refrigerated, so they’re really easy.” </p><h2 id="they-don-t-watch-the-clock">They Don’t Watch the Clock</h2><p>You should complete at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week—that’s long been The Department of Health and Human Services’s recommendation for <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-nutrition-advice-tips-for-weight-loss">total health</a>, at least. Chris, however, tells his clients to stop watching the clock—especially those who are new to exercise. “When it comes to <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-weight-loss-exercises-in-the-world">cardio</a>, maximizing weight loss is not about a set duration or intensity. It’s about slowly—but surely—making progress. Every two weeks increase the duration and intensity by just a little bit,” Powell suggests. “Month after month you slowly improve, and soon will be insanely fit and see incredible weight loss results!” To maximize results, make time to <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/7-exercise-fitness-mistakes-that-prevent-weight-loss">weight train</a> at least twice a week. The more muscle you have, the more calories your body will burn at rest, he adds.</p><h2 id="they-make-special-requests">They Make Special Requests</h2><p>“Participants find it challenging to stay on track with their diet when they’re eating out—especially when they’re with friends who don’t share their newly adopted healthy lifestyle,” says Powell. There are few different ways Powell helps his clients stay on track when facing this obstacle. For starters, he suggests drinking a big glass of water before the meal starts. This tames hunger, making it easier to order a smart entree. “Steer clear of anything fried, sautéed, crusted, or breaded, and order all dressing and sauces on the side,” he advises. “When you order, let the waiter know you would like a to-go box when the food arrives. Cut your meal in half immediately and place half in the box to go,” he suggests. Out of sight, out of mind—and don’t forget, similar rules apply to <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/take-control-of-your-takeout-order">take out food</a>, too.</p><h2 id="they-clean-house">They Clean House</h2><p>“Whether you have ten pounds to lose or 100, the first thing you should do is create an environment for success,” says Powell. That requires removing all temptation from your kitchen. “Collect all of the processed, sugary and fatty foods from your house, and bring them to a local food bank for donation. Then restock your kitchen with <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/16-must-have-staples-flat-belly-kitchen">healthy groceries</a>—real, natural, whole foods—like fresh fruits and <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-vegetables-to-eat-for-healthy-weight-loss">vegetables</a>, almonds and lean proteins like turkey, chicken, fish and eggs,” he suggests.</p><p><br/><br/><strong><a target="_blank

"It's the number one thing that our customers have been calling about," Seth Kaufman, PepsiCo's senior VP, told the Associated Press.</p><p>But here’s the catch: PepsiCo added new artificial sweeteners in the place of aspartame—specifically a blend of sucralose (Splenda) and acesulfame potassium (also called acesulfame K). Though these sweeteners are considered a bit healthier than aspartame, research suggests consuming them can still increase the odds of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/reasons-you-gain-weight-back-after-losing-it">weight gain</a>.

Beyond as an ally in the battle against the bulge, EVOO is a go-to pick for <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-fruits-for-total-health-and-weight-loss">total health</a> thanks to its heart-healthy monounsaturated fats. But it’s not all good news: Even if you go out of your way to buy extra virgin olive oil over other varieties, that may not be what’s inside the bottle. </p><p>Earlier this year, The National Consumers League (NCL) tested 11 different “extra virgin” olive oils from various grocery stores including Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Safeway and Giant. They discovered that six of them were not extra virgin oils. Some of the oils were simply treated in the wrong manner to be considered extra virgin (which diminishes the rich olive flavor and lowers the vitamin and mineral content). But in most cases, the bottles were actually filled with a mix of olive and <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/the-link-between-soybean-oil-and-weigh-gain">soybean oil</a>, a less costly source of fat that’s been proven to cause <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-habits-make-you-fat">weight gain</a> in animals — and may have similar effects on humans.</p><p>But before you start panicking, keep reading: There were five oils that did pass the NCL’s test, including: </p><p>California Olive Ranch "Extra Virgin Olive Oil"<br/>Colavita "Extra Virgin Olive Oil"<br/>Lucini "Premium Select Extra Virgin Olive Oil"<br/>Trader Joe's "Extra Virgin California Estate Olive Oil"<br/>Trader Joe's "100% Italian Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil"</p><p>Wondering which brands failed the test? Us, too! The NCL didn’t release that information and, what’s worse, there’s no proven way for consumers to tell if an oil is the variety it claims to be.

Although it isn’t as sweet as the classic dessert, the underlying flavors are spot on—delicious and satisfying. </p><p><strong>Eat This! Because:</strong> Steel cut oats are higher in fiber and have a lower glycemic index than other oat varieties, which helps keep hunger at bay hours after eating. While standard steel-cut oats take forever to cook, this pre-cooked take on the morning classic comes in a convenient grab-and-go box and is ready to eat in just minutes. Not to mention, the oats are low in sugar and free of artificial flavors—a rarity in the flavored-oatmeal category. </p><p><strong>Best Way to Eat It:</strong> Pour it in a bowl, zap it and eat it as is—no need to add water. Alternatively, you can add 1% or unsweetened <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-worst-milk-alternatives">milk alternatives</a> for an additional hit of protein and a more soupy consistency. If you’re looking for a stronger flavor, add a shake of cinnamon and a handful of finely chopped apple to your bowl.</p><p><strong>Secret Ingredient:</strong> Cinnamon is the dynamic addition to this starchy start to your morning. This sweet spice helps balance blood sugar levels thanks to active compound cinnamaldehyde, which helps your body move excess glucose out of the blood that it would otherwise store as body fat.</p><p><strong>Nutritionals:</strong> Per 10-ounce container: 200 calories, 2.5 g fat, 0 g saturated fat, 240 mg sodium, 40 g carbs, 4 g fiber, 8 g sugar, 4 g protein</p><p><br/><br/><strong><a target="_blank

And science suggests green tea, as it’s minimally processed and particularly rich in antioxidants, may be the most powerfully slimming variety.</span></p><p>Researchers attribute the fat-burning properties of green tea to catechins, specifically EGCG — the name of a group of antioxidative compounds that blast adipose tissue by revving the metabolism, increasing the release of fat from fat cells (particularly in the belly), and then speeding up the liver’s fat burning capacity. A recent study found by Polish researchers discovered the antioxidants also have the ability to limit the amount of starch (a form of carbohydrate) absorbed from a meal and improve sugar metabolism.</p><p>The best weight loss benefits come from unsweetened tea that’s freshly brewed. An average teabag contains about 70 mg of EGCG; and it’s worth noting that most studies citing significant health benefits come from high doses — 250-500 mg per day. So get your teapot ready! </p><p>Combining regular green-tea drinking with exercise may maximize the weight loss benefits, research suggests. In one study, participants who combined a daily habit of 4-5 cups of green tea with a 25-minute workout lost 2 more pounds than the non tea-drinking exercisers. And a second study found EGCG supplementation before and after a 30-minute cycling (366 mg total) could increase fat-burning by 17%.</p><p>There are a number of ways you can boost the fat-burning potential from your cuppa:</p><p>Try <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/health-benefits-of-drinking-green-tea-with-lemon">green tea with lemon</a>.</p><p>And brew your tea this way for the best cup of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/how-to-make-the-perfect-cup-of-green-tea-for-weight-loss">green tea for weight loss</a>.</p><p><br/><br/>To learn more about the wonders of tea, and get started on a 7-day plan that will melt up to 10 pounds, buy the <em>7-Day Flat-Belly Tea Cleanse</em> now, exclusively in e-Book format.

They all have a negative impact on male fertility. That’s right guys, if you want to make a baby, you might want to lay off the breakfast meat.</span> </p><p>Researchers have known for some time that a man’s diet can influence the ability of his sperm to fertilize an egg, but it wasn’t clear which foods influence reproductive outcomes most prominently—until now. </p><p>New findings out of Massachusetts General Hospital suggest that eating processed and canned meats (think: Spam) decreases fertility in men. To come to this finding, researchers asked 141 men—who were either undergoing in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injections with their female partners—about their current meat intake. They discovered that men who ate the most processed meat had a 54 percent fertilization rate, while men who ate the least amount had an 82 percent fertilization rate. They also found that men who ate the most chicken had a 13 percent higher fertilization rate than those who ate the least. </p><p>But fear not, bacon lovers, researchers say there’s no need to kick your beloved breakfast meat to the curb altogether, so long as you eat an overall healthy diet. The research can't prove causation, only a correlation. "Perhaps it is not the meat that is the problem, but the dietary choices that men who eat bacon make," urology specialist, Dr. Elizabeth Kavaler, told CBS News. "Healthier dietary choices usually correlates with a healthier lifestyle, which may overall increase fertility outcomes," she added.</p><p>Until we know more, swap some of your bacon for chicken.

Forget Burger King and Chipotle. <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/grab-and-go-protein-shakes">Protein shakes</a> may be the fastest food of all.</span> </p><p>There’s little to no prep work, no cooking and minimal cleanup. Just throw the ingredients into a blender, let ‘er rip and enjoy. Easy, right? But when <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss">weight loss</a> or <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-perfect-muscle-building-foods">muscle growth</a> is the goal, picking the right ingredients for your post-pump concoction requires some thought. If you pick the right foods, you’re bound to see results. But with so many variables— liquids, proteins, carbs, fats and add-ins—protein shakes can go really wrong really fast, undoing all of your hard work in the gym. Follow our guide below to create tasty protein shakes— that will give you the body you want— every time you whip out the blender.</p><h2 id="pick-your-protein">PICK YOUR PROTEIN</h2><p><img alt="greek yogurt for protein shakes" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/744024859/greek-yogurt-should-you-be-eating-full-fat-yogurt.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>A lot of people think that protein powder is a mandatory shake ingredient, but <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/11-best-worst-greek-yogurts-weight-loss">Greek yogurt</a> and cottage cheese pack a ton of protein, too. And if a smoothie-like texture is what you crave, those dairy sources should be your go-tos.</p><p><strong>How Much:</strong> Whichever protein source you choose, aim for a serving that supplies around 20 grams of protein. Compared to consuming both larger and smaller amounts of the nutrient, research shows that 20 grams most effectively stimulates muscle repair post-pump. Adding more protein won’t hurt the cause — but it won’t help, either.</p><p><strong>Our Go-Tos:</strong> If you’re sticking with <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-protein-powder-every-goal">protein powder</a>, we suggest plant-based varieties that combine hemp, rice and pea proteins. Blending all three ensures you’re getting a complete source of protein, which includes muscle-building and health-promoting amino acids that the body cannot make on its own. When it comes to yogurt, we’re partial to Fage 2% because of its high-protein, low-sugar profile. It also provides a bit of milk fat, which helps the body absorb the fat-soluble vitamins in the yogurt.</p><h2 id="choose-your-liquid">CHOOSE YOUR LIQUID</h2><p><img alt="iced coffee for protein shakes" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/502932425/cold-brew-coffee.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><p>Taste and nutrition-wise, the liquid you choose will make up the bulk of your beverage.</p><p><strong>How Much:</strong> 8 ounces</p><p><strong>Our Go-Tos:</strong> Water, coffee, grass-fed 1% milk or unsweetened <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-worst-milk-alternatives">milk alternatives</a> are all fair game. Which one you choose depends on your goal and lifestyle: If you’re trying to lose weight, stick with H20; if you workout in the a.m., a cup of iced coffee an energizing, low-cal option; and if you're aiming to up your protein intake, cow’s milk is the best bet. Vegans who don’t like the idea of water-based drink should use an unsweetened milk alternative.</p><h2 id="amp-up-the-carb-count">AMP UP THE CARB COUNT</h2><p><img alt="strawberries for protein shakes" src=" http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/823156417/strawberries-fruit-veggies-youre-eating-wrong.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><p>Sure, getting protein after a workout is important, but you also need to consume carbs to replenish your depleted energy stores. </p><p><strong>How Much:</strong> After a workout, your body needs a snack—or in this case, a shake—with a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio of carbs to protein. If your workout went longer than 90 minutes, opt for the latter. If weight loss if your goal, go for the former. Since you’re aiming for 20 grams of protein, 20 to 40 grams of carbs will provide the proper proportion of nutrients. </p><p>But before loading your drink with tons of fruit to hit that number, you’ll want to check your liquid and protein sources for carb counts. A Fage 2% yogurt, for example, supplies the recommended 20 grams of protein but also carries eight grams of carbs. If you use yogurt and water as your shake base, you’ll want to add 12-32 grams of carbs to your drink.</p><p><strong>Our Go-Tos:</strong> A medium banana provides about 30 grams of carbs and a cup of sliced <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/8-best-fat-burning-foods">strawberries</a>—a fruit that prevents fat from forming—provides 13 grams. If you’re craving a colder, slushy-like drink, use frozen fruit and ax some of the ice, which can water down the flavor.</p><h2 id="add-some-fat">ADD SOME FAT</h2><p><img alt="peanut butter for protein shakes" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/937993707/peanut-butter-11-more-nutrition-myths-busted.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><p>You’ve heard it time and time again: <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/8-best-fats-for-weight-loss">healthy fats</a> will not make you fat. In fact, consuming foods like nuts, seeds, nut butters and avocados after you workout can help speed recovery time, enhance <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-foods-to-eat-for-muscle-and-strength">muscle growth</a> and reduce the risk of injury by protecting joints from wear, inflammation and soreness, says Cassie Bjork, RD, LD of <a target="_blank" href="http://healthysimplelife.com">Healthy Simple Life</a>. </p><p><strong>How Much:</strong> A 1:1:1 or 2:1:1 ratio of carbs to protein to fat is ideal, so you’ll want to get 20 grams of healthy fat into your shake. But again, it doesn’t all need to come from an additional source. Chances are good your protein, liquid and carb sources will carry some fats. So be sure to subtract those out of the equation. </p><p><strong>Our Go-Tos:</strong> A two-tablespoon serving of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/16-best-nut-butters">peanut butter</a> provides 16 grams of fat, 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed carries 6 grams, 25 almonds has 15 grams of fat and 2 tablespoons of hemp seeds provides 10 grams of fat.</p><h2 id="boost-the-flavor">BOOST THE FLAVOR</h2><p><img alt="cinnamon for protein shakes" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/349849551/cinnamon-pays-splurge-on-food.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><p>Elevate the taste of your shake to the next level with tasty, low-cal additions like cocoa powder, vanilla extract and cinnamon, a sweet spice that stabilizes blood sugar and wards off insulin spikes.</p><h2 id="drink-this-">DRINK THIS!</h2><p>If you need ideas to get you started, try these <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-protein-shake-recipes-weight-loss">protein shake recipes</a>.

Stick with the thin or, at the very least, avoid the “hand-stretched” Brooklyn variety, which claims the highest calorie count. But, of course, the crust won’t get you in nearly as much trouble as what goes on top, and the ExtravaganZZA Feast toppings are a whole lot of trouble. For this pie, Domino’s piles pepperoni, ham, Italian sausage and beef onto extra cheese.

Blumberg</em></small></span></p><p><span class="large-txt">Some foods get all the credit: bananas for their potassium, <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-superfoods-healthier-than-kale">kale</a> as the leanest green and carrots for their eye-boosting abilities.</span></p><p>But beyond the ever-extolled eye superfood, carrots, there are many diet-friendly foods that are an asset to your waistline and a wonder for keeping your eyes healthy. To help you eat your way to better vision — without living on rabbit food — we reached out to Chip Goehring, Board President of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macular.org/cookbook">American Macular Degeneration Foundation</a> (AMDF). Goehring, who was diagnosed with macular degeneration and told he might go blind 22 years ago, can still see, read and drive — a result he credits to science-backed foods and supplements. Inspired to help others, Goehring and AMDF’s Director of Special Projects had the idea to create <em>Eat Right For Your Sight</em> based on 20 years of the foundation’s research.</p><p>Add these double-duty <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-best-foods-rapid-weight-loss">weight loss foods</a> that also protect your peepers to your diet with tips from Goehring for how to enjoy them deliciously. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">1</div><div class="title">Edamame</div></div></div><p><img alt="best weight loss foods edamame" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/650050904/edamame.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>You’ll want to befriend this lean, green soybean stat. “Edamame is a complete protein that also contains omega-3 fatty acids, which support the healthy development of your brain, nerves and eyes,” says Goehring. And this mighty green bean is also a powerful <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss">weight loss</a> ally. Upping your intake of plant foods like edamame decreases your risk of obesity, according to research. One of the most significant factors in the battle against the bulge is the fiber content of weight loss foods like soybeans. High fiber promotes feelings of fullness between meals, keeping you away from less <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/50-best-healthy-snacks-for-weight-loss">healthy snacks</a>, countless studies have shown. With 8 grams of fiber per cup, edamame is fiber-rich and calorie-low — a nutritional duo we can get behind. Goehring suggests sprinkling them in salads and using them in curries. </p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Try swapping out your fat-laden potato chips in favor of protein-packed dry-roasted edamame. It’s one of our favorite low-carb snacks and boasts an impressive 11 grams of protein per 100-calorie pack. Stash a couple at work to ward off the dreaded 3 pm slump.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">2</div><div class="title">Oysters</div></div></div><p><img alt="oysters for eye health" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/373153852/oysters-testosterone-boost.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>These slimy shellfish may not be proven to make you feel frisky, but science says they’ll help you build <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-foods-to-eat-for-muscle-and-strength">lean muscle</a> and also protect your peepers. A 3-ounce serving clocks in under 90 calories and is a low-fat way to get a hearty dose of protein. Just one serving serves up 10 to 16 grams of the bicep-building nutrient. But that’s not all they have going for them. “In addition to being a great source of protein, oysters also have a lot of zinc. This mineral helps convert vitamin A, a vital nutrient for eye health, into a usable form and transport it through blood,” Goehring explains. “Recent studies also suggest that zinc can slow the progression of macular degeneration,” he adds.</p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>“Fresh oysters simply grilled and topped with breadcrumbs and cheese are a treat for the palate and the eyes,” shares Goehring. For a more weight-loss friendly version of breadcrumbs, use whole-wheat bread, or swap the bread for walnuts. Simply place the desired amount of nuts in a ziploc bag and roll over with a rolling pin or pound down with a mallet until they reach desired consistency.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">3</div><div class="title">Grapes</div></div></div><p><img alt="grapes best weight loss foods" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/897345764/red-grapes.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>“Grapes contain anthocyanin, a name used for certain purple, blue or red antioxidants that may help boost collagen structure in the retina,” says Goehring. This protects your eyes and may help guard you against macular degeneration. And those same anthocyanins that help protect your eyes will help you see some weight loss wins thanks to their ability to inhibit inflammatory chemicals. In fact, women who consumed the most berries, grapes and red wine had lower levels of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-foods-for-gut-health">inflammation</a> and insulin resistance, two factors that help ward off diabetes, than those who consumed less, according to recent research in <em>The Journal of Nutrition</em>. Dark grapes, which boast high amounts of ellagic acid, are a particularly good choice as they can spike <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/8-best-fat-burning-foods">fat burning</a> in your body.</p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Eat as many (natural) red and purple foods as you can. Buy frozen berries or pop your grapes and berries in the freezer before eating. The healthy antioxidants that boost eye health are found mainly in the skins of these fruits, and subjecting them to lower temperatures changes the structure and makes the healthy compounds more available, researchers say.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">4</div><div class="title">Butternut<br/> Squash</div></div></div><p><img alt="butternut squash for eye health" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/428166650/butternut-squash.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>Your skinny jeans and baby blues will both be happy with this choice. “Butternut squash is rich in carotenoids, which are a vital nutrient for eye growth and development,” explains Goehring. And when you’re craving a starchy side, but working to meet your weight loss goals, butternut squash should be your go-to. It easily transforms into a silky side with more <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/vitamins-youre-not-getting-enough-of">vitamins and minerals</a> and far fewer calories than butter-laden mashed potatoes or fatty mac and cheese. </p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>“One of my favorite ways to serve it is as a roasted squash hummus dressed up with cilantro, walnuts and pomegranate seeds. Serve the hummus with warm whole-wheat tortillas as a healthy snack or appetizer,” Goehring suggests. It's also perfect for comforting soups. When looking to lose weight, you may have blacklisted creamy soups from your kitchen, but pureed butternut squash proves a great swap for calorie- and fat-laden butter and cream. It won’t add any fat to the recipe, but it will lend the velvety texture you crave without the calorie overdose.</p><p><br/><br/><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/MR/ETM/ETM_Yahoo_Mar15.jsp?cds_page_id=183370&cds_mag_code=ETM&id=1433344797224&lsid=51541019572027852&vid=1">DON’T DIET.

While other bars give you a hint of the true rich, earthy taste of cocoa beans, this bar brings it front and center. With notes of sweet stone fruits, one or two squares is all you need to get an immediate fix for even the most stubborn chocolate craving — without derailing your <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss">weight loss</a> efforts.</p><p><strong>Eat This! Because:</strong> This bar earns the label “excellence." The cocoa in this darker than dark treat isn’t adulterated with processing or excess sugar. In fact, there are no scary emulsifiers like soy lecithin commonly found in chocolate, and a couple squares satisfy without setting off an urge to overeat. In fact, while other dark chocolate bars can pack up to 14 grams of sugar per serving, this one boasts an unrivaled five. As if that weren't enough of a reason to swap your signature selection in favor of this superior bar, this one packs a surprising amount of protein and fiber thanks to Lindt’s dedication to keeping the ingredients minimally processed.</p><p><strong>Best Way to Eat It:</strong> The intense flavor makes this bar the perfect way to end the day. The flavor lingers, so you’ll cap off a day of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-healthy-foods-youre-overeating">healthy eating</a> with a sweet treat you can enjoy guilt-free. If you love the health benefits of this bar but can’t quite take the robust flavor by itself, pair it with some berries for a no-mess snack reminiscent of chocolate-covered strawberries.</p><p><strong>Secret Ingredient:</strong> Non-alkalized cocoa powder. Alkalization is the processing that most cocoa powder goes through to lessen that bitter, earthy taste characteristic of the darkest varieties. But it’s also a process that strips out all the health benefits of the cocoa bean the powder has in its truest form. Tempted to be better and reach for the 90%? Don’t!

There are pancakes and waffles, danishes and muffins, colorful cereals and savory egg sandwiches—and better yet, it’s all supposed to help you <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss">lose weight</a>.</span></p><p>The key phrase being <em>supposed to</em>. </p><p>While some believe that sitting down to a nutritionally-lacking breakfast is better than skipping the morning meal altogether, it’s best to stick to healthy breakfast foods when you’re serious about losing weight and getting a <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/how-to-burn-fat-and-get-a-flat-stomach-without-going-to-the-gym">flat stomach</a>. But it can be challenging identifying your best bets. While some breakfast foods are obvious indulgences (hello, cinnamon buns), other, seemingly healthy choices can also sabotage your success. </p><p>Swap your a.m go-tos for our delicious slimming picks below to jump-start your progress while you’re still in your PJs—now <em>that’s</em> what we call a productive morning!</p><h2 id="when-you-re-craving-toasty-carbs">WHEN YOU’RE CRAVING TOASTY CARBS</h2><h3 id="-eat-this-"><strong>Eat This!</strong></h3><p><strong>Sprouted Grain Toast with Peanut Butter</strong></p><h3 id="-not-that-"><strong>Not That!</strong></h3><p><strong>Whole Grain Bagel with Butter</strong></p><p>Even if they’re whole-wheat, bagels can pack as many calories as three or four slices of bread. Scary, right? Skip the buttered bagel—a combination that will cost you about 340 calories and 50 grams of carbs—and spread a tablespoon of natural <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/16-best-nut-butters">peanut butter</a> on two slices of sprouted grain bread instead. (We like Food For Life’s Ezekiel 4:9 varieties, which are found in the freezer section and made with sprouted wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet and brown rice). The savory swap provides eight grams of flab-fighting protein, four grams of satiating fat and will save you nearly 80 calories a day. If you stick with the nut butter and bread for a mere month and a half, you’ll drop a pound of fat from your frame. </p><p>If nuts aren't your thing, mashed <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/8-reasons-avocado-perfect-weight-loss-food">avocado</a> also makes a filling toast topper that fights fat. </p><h2 id="when-you-need-something-fruity">WHEN YOU NEED SOMETHING FRUITY</h2><p><img alt="oranges" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/605529960/oranges.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><h3 id="-eat-this-"><strong>Eat This!</strong></h3><p><strong>Orange</strong></p><h3 id="-not-that-"><strong>Not That!</strong></h3><p><strong>8-Ounce Glass of Orange Juice</strong></p><p>Swap your daily cup of orange juice for an actual orange. A piece of fruit not only costs a lot less than a carton of juice but also provides more belly-filling, health-promoting fiber for a fraction of the calories and sugar.

Morning classics such as these tend to be high in sugar, which can mess with your blood sugar and leave your stomach growling soon after you’ve finished eaten.

Swap your fruit-flavored yogurt (which could easily be filled with 30 grams of the sweet stuff) for a plain, low-sugar variety like Fage 2%. To add a hint of flavor, top it off with your favorite berries. Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries are all packed with polyphenols, naturally occurring chemicals that aid weight loss and stop <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/8-best-fat-burning-foods">fat cells</a> from forming.

But if you make a switch to the turkey variety in the name of weight loss, you’ll be doing your body—and your taste buds—a disservice. Sure, ditching the pork saves you 13 calories and a gram of fat per slice, but its poultry replacement is packed with excess sodium. Starting your day with all this salt will cause your body to retain water, giving your stomach a paunchy, <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/8-food-remedies-for-bloating">bloated</a> look — even if you’ve lost belly fat. Plus, pork offers more satiating protein and heart-healthy monounsaturated fats than turkey versions. Bear in mind that no matter which option you add to your breakfast plate, serving size matters.

After controlling for a number of factors including family medical history, age, diabetes and smoking, the researchers found that participants who consumed hot and spicy food once or twice a week had a 10 percent reduced risk for death compared to those who shied away from savoring spicy food once a week. And people who turned up the heat six or seven times a week had a 14 percent lower risk of death. The correlation between spicy food consumption and decreased risk of mortality was even stronger in those who don’t drink alcohol. Capsaicin, the ingredient that gives chili peppers their <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/6-ways-to-boost-your-metabolism">metabolism</a>-boosting fire, is likely to thank for its life-lengthening properties, according to the recent <em>BMJ</em> study.</p><p>“We need more evidence, especially from clinical trials, to further verify these findings, and we are looking forward to seeing data from other populations,” study co-author Dr. Lu Qi, an associate professor of nutrition at the Harvard, said in a statement.

Sadly, the Tupperware approach will get you sad, soggy greens, a result of veggies sitting in dressing just a little too long.

What you choose to put on your plate has an even greater effect on your metabolism and muscle development. “Protein is key to <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss">weight loss</a> because it slows down the absorption of carbohydrates," explains Jim White RD, ACSM HFS, Owner of <a target="_blank" href="http://jimwhitefit.com/">Jim White Fitness and Nutrition Studios</a>. This helps delay the onset of sugar highs and lows, which can trigger fat storage.</p><p>Whether you’re trying to slim down or tone it up, your body needs a steady supply of protein. And many classic breakfast foods can give you what you need. All that’s left for you to decide is whether it’s an omelet or a parfait kind of morning. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">1</div><div class="title">Eggs</div></div></div><p><img alt="high protein breakfast eggs" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/290905292/fried-egg-chives.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/><strong>Protein Payoff:</strong> 6.29 grams per egg</p><p>It doesn’t matter if you like your eggs scrambled, over easy or — no judgement — Rocky-style raw, you’ve got a breakfast that will jumpstart your <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/6-easy-ways-burn-fat">fat burn</a> from the first bite — as long as you go easy on the oil and cheese. Eggs contain all the necessary amino acids for lean muscle development and help promote lasting feelings of fullness. This classic breakfast item also contains nutrients vital to healthy skin, immune system, brain and liver functioning such as vitamin A, riboflavin and choline, all which are found inside that bright yellow yolk! So don’t be too quick to dismiss that nutrient-packed center. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">2</div><div class="title">2% Plain<br/>Greek Yogurt</div></div></div><p><img alt="high protein breakfast greek yogurt" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/381298888/greek-yogurt-pots.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/><strong>Protein Payoff:</strong> 20 grams per 7 ounces</p><p>The overachiever of weight loss foods, <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/11-best-worst-greek-yogurts-weight-loss">Greek yogurt</a> is the golden child of many nutritionists and no-brainer for people looking to slim down. The low calorie count and impressive punch of body-building protein are only the beginning of this dairy staple’s slim-down skills. Yogurt is rich in <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/6-flat-belly-foods-healthy-gut">good bacteria</a> that encourage gut and digestive health, and will also keep things moving along nicely — banishing belly bloat. Toss in some antioxidant-rich berries and healthy fat-filled nuts like almonds or walnuts, and you’ve got an easy, balanced meal that will help melt away fat and promote healthy muscle growth. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">3</div><div class="title">Peanut<br/> Butter</div></div></div><p><img alt="high protein breakfast peanut butter" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/457632374/peanut-butter-health-food-impostors.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/><strong>Protein Payoff:</strong> 8 grams per 2 tablespoons</p><p>Nut butter is the intense friend in the high-protein breakfast posse; calorically dense, it’s best in small doses. Add a measured dollop to your <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/overnight-oat-recipes-for-weight-loss">overnight oats</a>, <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/only-smoothies-you'll-need-video">weight loss smoothies</a>, or whole-wheat toast. The one-two punch of carbs and protein fuels your body and brain to help you tackle all the morning has in store.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">4</div><div class="title">Low-Fat<br/> Cottage Cheese</div></div></div><p><img alt="high protein breakfast cottage cheese" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/480478623/cottage-cheese.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/><strong>Protein Payoff:</strong> 15 grams per half-cup</p><p>Slipping into diet obscurity with tuna casserole and Tang, cottage cheese is one bygone staple that deserves a comeback. It pairs perfectly with nutrient-rich berries and a sprinkle of cinnamon: a slim-down triple threat. This combination boasts the fat-frying power of protein, the belly fat blocking polyphenols of berries and the blood sugar-stabilizing skill of the sweet spice. Even if you enjoy it solo, the 15 grams of protein will fuel your morning by firing up your metabolism and satisfying your hunger for hours. And at only 100 calories per half-cup serving, you feel free to go back for seconds. If you’re worried about getting enough fiber and <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/8-fatty-foods-make-you-skinny">healthy fats</a> to keep you full and focused through the morning, pair a small bowl of the curds with a serving of oats or <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/mcdonalds-is-now-serving-avocado-toast">avocado toast</a>. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">5</div><div class="title">Chicken<br/> Sausage</div></div></div><p><img alt="high protein breakfast chicken sausage" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/402973506/chicken-sausage.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/><strong>Protein Payoff:</strong> 12 grams per link</p><p>Big breakfasts can add up to big <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/7-personal-trainers-reveal-their-top-weight-loss-tips">weight loss results</a> — with the right ingredients. Pairing lean chicken sausage with eggs in the morning will give your body a huge hit of protein and, as a result, increase calorie burn as your body works to digest it. These sweet and savory links may be low in calories, but they’re incredibly rich in flavor thanks to clean, organic chicken, herbs and spices. We like Bilinski’s Organic.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">6</div><div class="title">Quinoa</div></div></div><p><img alt="high protein breakfast quinoa" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/527869274/Quinoa-meat-free-proteins.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/><strong>Protein Payoff:</strong> 8 grams per cup cooked</p><p>Quinoa may be the star of veggie-filled lunchtime salads and healthy dinner side dishes, but it shouldn’t be blacklisted from the breakfast menu. This complex carb dishes up slow-burning fuel that will set your up for steady energy levels throughout the day. Protein and <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-complex-carbohydrates-to-eat-for-weight-loss">complex carbs</a> in this pseudograin team up to steady blood sugar and increase feelings of fullness — they’re your dream team defense against those donut holes in the break room. Make quinoa porridge by cooking quinoa in your milk of choice and then adding spices like cinnamon or cardamom and sprinkling on some crushed nuts. Essentially, anything you mix into oatmeal will mix just as well into a hot bowl of quinoa. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">7</div><div class="title">Skim<br/> Milk</div></div></div><p><img alt="high protein breakfast skim milk" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/398792922/look-better-naked-milk.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/><strong>Protein Payoff:</strong> 8 grams per cup</p><p>Sometimes it’s hard to stay away from the classics, like a good ol’ bowl of cereal and milk. As long as the box you choose has nutrition stats similar to our favorite <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-beakfast-cereals-to-eat-for-weight-loss">low sugar cereals</a> and plenty of fiber, it's the perfect quick and easy start to your day paired with skim milk. Sprinkle some pumpkin seeds or crushed nuts over your bowl for added healthy fats, just remember your measuring spoon. With the added topping, your bowl will boast an ideal balance of fiber, protein and fat to keep you on your toes all morning. </p><p><br/><br/><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/MR/ETM/ETM_Yahoo_Mar15.jsp?cds_page_id=183370&cds_mag_code=ETM&id=1433344797224&lsid=51541019572027852&vid=1">DON’T DIET.

You can quickly prove yourself the most interesting person at the table with the utterance of just one small word: Omega-3s. Purse your lips, drop The Big O, and watch the crowd go wild.</span> </p><p>That’s because recent studies on the benefits of essential fatty acids span the health-and-wellness spectrum: from protecting the heart and brain, to improving kids’ behavior; building lean muscle and turbocharging <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/rules-for-healthy-rapid-fat-loss">fat loss</a>. All of which should give your dining companions plenty to discuss. </p><p>Fish and nuts are most widely cited for their omega-3 content, with salmon as poster child. But there are a number of surprising sources that can help you meet your daily dose — 1100 to 600 milligrams, according to The Institute of Medicine. So peruse this life-enhancing list, add the <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-best-foods-rapid-weight-loss">weight loss foods</a> to your daily diet, and then enjoy dinner.

A solid curd made from mashed soybeans, it’s a terrific source of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/grab-and-go-protein-shakes">plant-based protein</a> with proven weight-loss potential. One study published in the journal <em>Nature</em> showed dieters who followed a 12-week meal plan that included a soy-based protein replacement lost twice as much weight and saw greater reductions in cholesterol and <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-daily-habits-blast-belly-fat">belly fat</a> than a control group whose equicaloric weight loss diet included protein from lean meats.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">2</div><div class="title">Wild<br/>rice</div></div></div><p><strong>Omega-3 Payoff:</strong> 480 mg per cup (raw) </p><p>Diet experts go ga-ga for brown rice, but it's wild rice that tugs on our heartstrings as a <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss">weight loss</a> wonder food. After all, the native American grain has nearly double the fiber and protein, <em>and</em> fewer calories than its arguably more popular cousin. Whole grains have a proven reputation as a weight-loss staple. In one study, Penn State researchers found dieters on a calorie-restricted diet who ate whole grains like rice lost significantly more belly fat than a group who consumed the equivalent number of calories from refined carbohydrates. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">3</div><div class="title">Red<br/>Lentils</div></div></div><p><img alt="omega 3 foods red lentils" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/460657081/red-lentils.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/><strong>Omega-3 Payoff:</strong> 480 mg per cup (raw)</p><p>Lentils are an inexpensive dietary pulse, touted by weight loss experts for their ability to boost fat metabolism and regulate appetites. Researchers say the slimming benefits can be attributed to <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/how-to-lose-weight-eating-resistant-starch">resistant starch</a>, a form of slow-digesting fiber that triggers the release of acetate, a molecule in the gut that signals the brain when it's time to stop eating. In fact, people who ate a daily serving of lentils (about ¾ cup) felt an average 31 percent fuller compared to a control diet, a systematic review of clinical trials on legumes found. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">4</div><div class="title">Chia<br/>Seeds</div></div></div><p><strong>Omega-3 Payoff:</strong> 4500 mg per 2 tablespoons (1 ounce)</p><p>With more omega-3s, gram for gram, than salmon, and double that of flaxseed, cha cha cha chia seeds are also one of the best sources of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/11-best-high-fiber-foods-weight-loss">dietary fiber</a> in the world. Just two tablespoons of the seed provide 11 grams of filling fiber — that’s more than you’ll find in 3 packets of Quaker Original Instant Oatmeal, and particularly good news for your waistline, researchers say. For every 10-gram increase in fiber eaten per day, belly fat reduced by 3.7 percent over five years, a recent study found. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">5</div><div class="title">Ground<br/>Mustard Seed</div></div></div><p><img alt="mustard seeds" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/603258460/mustard.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/><strong>Omega-3 Payoff:</strong> 100 mg per teaspoon</p><p>One tiny teaspoon of ground mustard provides 100 milligrams of Omega-3s, plus serious fat-burning potential. Scientists at England’s Oxford Polytechnic Institute found that a teaspoon of the hot stuff was enough to boost the <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/the-truth-about-how-to-boost-metabolism">metabolism</a> by up to 25% for several hours after eating. Researchers attribute the weight loss benefits to allyl isothiocyanates, compounds that give the mustard its characteristic flavor.

Recent research suggests compounds in the leaf membranes called thylakoids may also serve as a powerful appetite suppressant. Participants in the three-month study who drank a <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/healthy-smoothie-ingredients-for-weight-loss">breakfast smoothie</a> containing spinach thylakoids had fewer cravings and lost 5.5 pounds more than the placebo group.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">7</div><div class="title">Winter<br/>Squash</div></div></div><p><img alt="omega 3 foods winter squash" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/558358233/winter-squash.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/><strong>Omega-3 Payoff:</strong> 332 mg per cup (baked)</p><p>More squash = less squish. A cup of winter squash provides one-third the recommended daily intake of vitamin C — a nutrient researchers say is directly related to the body’s ability to burn through fat. In fact, one study by researchers from Arizona State University showed deficiencies of vitamin C were strongly correlated with increased <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/6-foods-that-turn-into-belly-fat">body fat</a> and waist measurements.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">8</div><div class="title">Fontina<br/>Cheese</div></div></div><p><strong>Omega-3 Payoff:</strong> 442 mg per 2-ounce serving</p><p>Dairy has made a dietary comeback, with new research suggesting the high-fat products like cheese may help reduce the risk of obesity.

Good news: You don’t have to look away.</span> </p><p>If you make an informed choice, adding a pastry to your cup of joe can be a reasonable treat. (Specialty coffee drinks—loaded with syrups, sweet junk like whipped cream, calories and carbs—can ruin your <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/weight-loss">weight loss</a> much faster.) Here are the best <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/15-best-low-sugar-snacks">low-sugar snacks</a> at all the major chains. </p><h2 id="starbucks">Starbucks</h2><h3 id="-petite-vanilla-bean-scone-"><strong>Petite Vanilla Bean Scone</strong></h3><p><em>120 calories, 4.5 g fat, 2 g saturated, 95 g sodium, 18 g carbs, 8 g sugar, 0 g fiber, 2 g protein</em></p><p>The world’s biggest coffee chain might have the most expansive offering of bakery treats, and you’ll want to exercise appropriate caution. (The highest-cal item on the <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/healthy-starbucks-secret-menu-items">Starbucks menu</a> is the innocent-seeming Old Fashioned Glazed Donut, with 480!) The best choice is this small scone, which is substantial enough for a quick pick-me-up.</p><h2 id="dunkin-donuts">Dunkin’ Donuts</h2><h3 id="-blueberry-coffee-cake-"><strong>Blueberry Coffee Cake</strong></h3><p><em>190 calories, 6 g fat, 1.5 g saturated, 170 mg sodium, 31 g carbs, 17 g sugars, 1 g fiber, 3 g protein</em></p><p>Among Dunkin’s famous fried rings, the Sugar Raised Donut is the lowest-cal option. But the best overall bakery item is the Blueberry Coffee Cake, with half the fat and 40 fewer calories than the Sugar Raised. Now avoid the Coolattas and syrups, and you’ve taken a guilt-free java break.</p><h2 id="tim-horton-s">Tim Horton’s</h2><h3 id="-sugar-loop-donut-"><strong>Sugar Loop Donut</strong></h3><p><em>180 calories, 6 g fat, 2.5 g saturated, 210 mg sodium, 28 g carbs, 8 g sugars, 1 g fiber, 4 g protein</em></p><p>At this donut shop, you’ll naturally want to steer clear of the Cake and Filled varieties. But surprisingly, the Glazed and Plain donuts aren’t the healthiest—the Sugar Loop donut takes that title, with about 20% fewer calories and half the fat. (If you’re craving something flavored, the Maple and Chocolate Dips have only 10 more calories.)</p><p><img alt="panera menu" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/913472070/panera-wild-blueberry-mini-scones.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><h2 id="panera">Panera</h2><h3 id="-wild-blueberry-mini-scone-"><strong>Wild Blueberry Mini Scone</strong></h3><p><em>160 calories, 7 g fat, 4 g saturated, 300 mg sodium, 22 g carbs, 8 g sugars, 1 g fiber, 3 g protein</em></p><p><a href="http://www.eatthis.com/these-healthy-meals-from-the-panera-menu-can-help-you-lose-weight-fast">Panera</a>’s offerings on the treat tip include cookies, brownies and sweet rolls (avoid them—the pecan roll has 740 calories!), but here again the best option is a scone. But be sure you make it a mini—the regular-size Cinnamon Crunch Scone is 550 calories, or more than a Big Mac! And stick with just one, which keeps sugar counts to a remarkable low for baked goods.</p><h2 id="peet-s">Peet’s</h2><h3 id="-blueberry-macaroon-cookie-"><strong>Blueberry Macaroon Cookie</strong></h3><p><em>140 calories, 10 g fat, 5 saturated, 80 mg sodium, 20 g carbs, 12 g sugars, 1 g fiber, 2 g protein</em></p><p>This coffee shop advertises “artisanal” treats made in small batches, and with this low calorie count, their Blueberry Macaroon is an atypical cookie indeed. It’s a seasonal offering, so if it’s not available in your area, opt for the Petite Chocolate or Lemon Currant Scones, which have 170 calories and 10 grams of fat.</p><h2 id="caribou-coffee">Caribou Coffee</h2><h3 id="-banana-bread-"><strong>Banana Bread</strong></h3><p><em>280 calories, 12 g fat, 6 g saturated, 340 mg sodium, 38 g carbs, 8 g sugars, 2 g fiber, 4 g protein</em></p><p>While coffee cake and scones are the best choices at other coffee shops, that’s not the case at Caribou, where the coffee cake runs 530 calories and the scones have 20% more calories than the Banana Bread, the option that also has the least amount of fat.

What was driving him to financial ruin? What sort of nettlesome money-sapping addiction had my friend in its grasp?</p><p>“Trying to eat healthy,” he explained. “For example, every Saturday I go to the farmers’ market and shell out $24 a pound—for kale! It’s costing me a fortune. But if you want to eat right, you gotta shell out for the good stuff, no?”</p><p>I shook my head. At Eat This, Not That!, we spend a lot of time unmasking health imposters. And the truth is, the superpowers of kale, like the dangers of the Bermuda Triangle, have been highly exaggerated. Sure, it’s good for you, but the ranking of kale as our greatest green is just one of many word-of-mouth myths that drive our nutritional decision-making, often in the wrong direction. Much of what we believe about food is really just hearsay, a game of nutritional telephone handed down from science journals to newspapers to television to your Aunt Phoebe to your mom and then to you, with marketers in between.</p><p>Well, we had the research team at <em>Eat This, Not That!</em> track down the truth. Learn how to separate fact from fiction and you might finally shed the habits that are silently sabotaging your <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/weight-loss">weight loss</a> efforts. But I must warn you: The truth can hurt.</p><h2 id="1-kale-is-our-healthiest-green">1. Kale is our healthiest green</h2><p>A 2014 study at William Paterson University ranked fruits and vegetables by their nutrient density, based on their levels of 17 different nutrients that have been linked to improved cardiovascular health. Not surprisingly, the top 16 were all leafy greens, which pack the most nutrition per calorie. (Coming in at #17 was red bell peppers.) But kale didn’t even make the top 10. In fact, simple spinach and even Romaine lettuce beat the alleged supergreen, as did parsley and chives. Even stuff you normally throw away--the greens atop beets--pack more nutrition. (Here's a list of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/slideshow/10-greens-healthier-kale">The 10 Superfoods Healthier Than Kale</a>, so you can mix up your salad rut.)</p><h2 id="2-high-fructose-corn-syrup-is-worse-than-table-sugar">2. High Fructose Corn Syrup is worse than table sugar</h2><p>Sugar is the master of disguise. Maltodextrin, brown rice syrup, dextrose, sucrose--it’s got more alter egos than the Avengers. But it’s most well known costume is High Fructose Corn Syrup. Whether HFCS is worse than plain ol' table sugar has long been a contentious issue. Here’s what you need to know: In a 2014 review of five studies comparing the effects of sugar and HFCS, there was no difference found in changes in blood glucose levels, lipid levels, or appetite between table sugar consumption and HFCS consumption. In other words, your body can’t tell one from the other—they’re both just sugar. HFCS’s real sin is that it’s super cheap, and as a result, it’s added to everything from cereal to ketchup to salad dressing. Is it a good idea to minimize the HFCS in your diet? Absolutely. It’s best to cut out all unnecessary sugars. But HFCS’s role as nutritional enemy #1 has been exaggerated. </p><h2 id="3-sea-salt-is-a-healthier-version-of-regular-salt">3. Sea salt is a healthier version of regular salt</h2><p>Everyday table salt comes from a mine and contains roughly 2,300 milligrams of sodium per teaspoon. Sea salt comes from evaporated seawater, and it also contains roughly 2,300 milligrams of sodium. That makes them, well, roughly identical. Advocates point to the fact that sea salt also contains other compounds like magnesium and iron, but in truth, these minerals exist in trace amounts. To obtain a meaningful dose, you’d have to take in extremely high and potentially dangerous levels of sodium. What’s more, traditional table salt is regularly fortified with iodine, which plays an important role in regulating the hormones in your body. Sea salt, on the other hand, gives you virtually zero iodine. The bottom line is this: If switching from table salt to sea salt causes you to consume even one extra granule, then you’ve just completely snuffed out whatever elusive health boon you hope to receive. Plus you’ve wasted a few bucks. Reduce the bloat with our <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/4-step-plan-to-break-your-salt-habit">4-Step Plan to Break Your Salt Habit</a>!</p><h2 id="4-energy-drinks-are-less-harmful-than-soda">4. Energy drinks are less harmful than soda</h2><p>Energy drinks like Red Bull, Monster, and Full Throttle attempt to boost your energy with a cache of B vitamins, herbal extracts, and amino acids. But what your body’s going to remember most (especially around your waistline) is the sugar in these concoctions; a 16-ounce can delivers as much as 280 calories of pure sugar, which is about 80 calories more than you’d find in a 16-ounce cup of Pepsi. What’s more, a University of Maryland study found energy drinks to be 11 percent more corrosive to your teeth than regular soda. So here’s the secret that energy drink companies don’t want you to know: The only proven, significant energy boost comes from caffeine. If you want an energy boost, save yourself the sugar spike and drink a cup of coffee. (A cup of black joe: 5 calories.

Diet sodas help keep you slim</h2><p>The obesity-research community is becoming increasingly aware that the artificial sweeteners used in diet soda—aspartame and sucralose, for instance—lead to hard-to-control food urges later in the day. One Purdue study discovered that rats took in more calories if they'd been fed artificial sweeteners prior to mealtime, and a University of Texas study found that people who consume just three diet sodas per week were more than 40 percent more likely to be obese. Try weaning yourself off by switching to carbonated water and flavoring with lemon, cucumber, and fresh herbs.</p><p>A study in the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em> found that more obese adults drink diet soda than healthy-weight adults and that, among the overweight and obese adults studied, those who drank diet soda ate more calories than those who consumed sweetened/regular soda. Researchers have also linked regular diet soda consumption with decreased response to artificial sweeteners and a decreased link between sweet tastes and energy value, meaning their bodies may grow to disassociate sweetness with satiety cues, making it easier to overeat and, therefore, gain weight.For more, read these essential <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/surprising-reasons-to-still-give-up-soda">5 Reasons to Finally Give Up Soda</a>.</p><h2 id="6-low-fat-foods-are-better-for-you">6. Low-fat foods are better for you</h2><p>As it applies to food marketing, the term “low fat” is synonymous with “loaded with salt and cheap carbohydrates.” For instance, look at Smucker’s Reduced Fat Peanut Butter. To replace the fat it skimmed out, Smucker’s added a fast-digesting carbohydrate called maltodextrin. That’s not going to help you lose weight. A 2008 study in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> found that over a 2-year span, people on low-carb diets lost 62 percent more body weight than those trying to cut fat. (Plus, the fat in peanut butter is heart-healthy monounsaturated fat—you’d be better off eating more of it, not less!)</p><h2 id="7-trans-fat-free-foods-are-actually-trans-fat-free">7. “Trans-fat free” foods are actually trans-fat free</h2><p>The FDA’s guidelines allow companies to claim 0 grams of trans fat—even broadcast it on the front of their packages—as long as the food in question contains no more than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving. But here’s the deal: Due to an inextricable link to heart disease, the World Health Organization advises people to keep trans fat intake as low as possible, maxing out at about 1 gram per 2,000 calories consumed. If your cupboard’s full of foods with almost half a gram per serving, you might be blowing past that number every single day. The <em>American Journal of Health Promotion</em> recently published an article urging the FDA to rethink its lax regulations, but until that happens, you should avoid all foods with “partially hydrogenated oil” (meaning, trans fats) on their ingredients statements. Read more about <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/trans-fat-causes-memory-loss">The Ingredient That Eats Away at Your Memory</a>!</p><h2 id="8-foods-labeled-natural-are-healthier">8. Foods labeled “natural” are healthier</h2><p>The FDA makes no serious effort to control the use of the word "natural" on nutrition labels. Case in point: 7UP boasts that it’s made with “100% Natural Flavors” when, in fact, the soda is sweetened with a decidedly un-natural dose of high fructose corn syrup. “Corn” is natural, but “high fructose corn syrup” is produced using a centrifuge and a series of chemical reactions. Other "natural" abusers include Natural Cheetos, which are made with maltodextrin and disodium phosphate, and “natural advantage” Post Raisin Bran, which bathes its raisins in both sugar and corn syrup. The worst part is, you're likely paying a premium price for common junk food.</p><h2 id="9-yogurt-is-good-for-the-bacteria-in-your-belly">9. Yogurt is good for the bacteria in your belly</h2><p>Sure, some yogurts contain beneficial bacteria that can send reinforcements to your gut when you need them. Lactobacillus acidophilus is the bacteria you want to look for, with yogurts that say “live active cultures.” But most yogurts are so high in sugar that they do more to promote unhealthy gut bacteria than anything else. (Unhealthy bacteria feed on sugar in your belly the same way they do around your teeth.) No need to read every label at the store; we did the legwork to track down the <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/slideshow/best-worst-yogurts">Best Brand-Name Yogurts for Weight-Loss</a>!</p><h2 id="10-egg-yolks-raise-your-cholesterol">10. Egg yolks raise your cholesterol</h2><p>Egg yolks contain dietary cholesterol; this much is true. But research has proven that dietary cholesterol has almost nothing to do with serum cholesterol, the stuff in your blood. Wake Forest University researchers reviewed more than 30 egg studies and found no link between egg consumption and heart disease, and a study in Saint Louis found that eating eggs for breakfast could decrease your calorie intake for the remainder of the day.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/937993707/peanut-butter-11-more-nutrition-myths-busted.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><h2 id="11-peanut-butter-is-a-health-food">11. Peanut butter is a health food</h2><p>In its best form, peanut butter actually is a health food. That’s because peanuts are packed with monounsaturated fats, the heart-healthy fat that actually helps you lose weight. Here’s what the ingredients of a healthy jar of peanut butter should read:</p><p>Peanuts.</p><p>But most peanut butter doesn’t look like that. Here’s what the label of Jif Reduced Fat Creamy Peanut Butter Spread reads like:</p><p><em>Peanuts, corn syrup solids, sugar, pea protein, salt, fully hydrogenated vegetable oils, mono and diglycerides, molasses, magnesium oxide, niacinamide, ferric orthophosphate, zinc oxide, copper sulfate, folic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride.</em></p><p>Now, I know your kids constantly beg you for seconds of pyridoxine hydrochloride, but is that something they need? Most peanut butters are highly processed and loaded with sugars and trans-fatty oils, and contain less of the healthy monounsaturated fats that you truly need. “Peanut butter spread” is even worse. The word “spread” indicates that it’s at least 10 percent additives. Look for ”natural” peanut butter (Smucker’s and Justin’s both make great versions) and don’t be fooled by any low-fat promises.

Dark Chocolate is good for you</h2><p>It would be great if the only thing you had to do to eat healthy was look for chocolate bars that were darker than Kristen Stewart’s mascara. Unfortunately, the secret to unlocking the health benefits of chocolate are a bit more complicated than that. Plenty of studies have shown that polyphenols—nutrients found in darkly colored plant foods like chocolate—can do everything from lowering blood pressure to raising our ability to burn fat. A 2013 study in the journal <em>Diabetic Medicine</em> even found that eating dark chocolate lessened the effects of high blood sugar in diabetic patients. Unfortunately, the more chocolate is processed, the more of the polyphenols are lost. Creating “Dutch” chocolate, in which an alkalizing agent is added to the cocoa to reduce acidity, destroys up to 77 percent of the nutrients in the cocoa. To get the health benefits that have been touted since the time of Montezeuma, look for a dark chocolate that says 70% cacao (or higher) on the label. The rest? It’s just candy.</p><h2 id="13-oatmeal-is-good-for-you">13. Oatmeal is good for you</h2><p>Okay, oatmeal really is good for you. If it’s just oatmeal that you made from scratch, and then sweetened yourself with a little fruit. But most of what’s sold as oatmeal today is more like a package of Kool-Ade mix. Consider Instant Quaker Oatmeal Strawberries & Cream, which features delicious sounding “flavored and colored fruit pieces.” What does that mean, exactly? What they’ve done is taken dried apples and/or figs and injected them with corn syrup solids, cornstarch, and trans fats, and mixed it in something called a “creaming agent.” Or check out the Fruit & Maple Oatmeal offering at McDonald’s. It’s a breakfast cereal with 32 grams of sugar--the equivalent of nearly 13 cups of Kix cereal!

Bananas are the best source of potassium</h2><p>Your body uses potassium to keep your nerves and muscles firing efficiently, and an adequate intake can blunt sodium’s effect on blood pressure. One 2009 study found that a 2:1 ratio of potassium to sodium could halve your risk of heart disease, and since the average American consumes about 3,400 milligrams of sodium each day, your goal should be 6,800 milligrams of daily potassium. You’re extremely unlikely to ever reach that mark—and never with bananas alone. One medium banana has 422 milligrams and 105 calories. Here are the sources that earn you roughly the same amount of potassium in fewer calories:</p><ul>
<li>Potato, half a medium spud, 80 calories</li>
<li>Apricots, 5 whole fruit, 80 calories</li>
<li>Cantaloupe, 1 cup cubes, 55 calories</li>
<li>Broccoli, 1 full stalk, 50 calories</li>
<li>Sun-dried tomatoes, a quarter cup, 35 calories</li>
</ul><h2 id="15-oranges-are-the-best-source-of-vitamin-c">15. Oranges are the best source of vitamin C</h2><p>Far more than a simple immune booster, vitamin C is an antioxidant that plays a host of important roles in your body. It strengthens skin by helping to build collagen, improves mood by increasing the flow of norepinephrine, and bolsters metabolic efficiency by helping transport fat cells into the body’s energy-burning mitochondria. But since your body can neither store nor create the wonder vitamin, you need to provide a constant supply. An orange is the most famous vitamin-C food, and although it’s a good source, it’s by no means the best. For 70 calories, one orange gives you about 70 micrograms of vitamin C. Here are five sources with just as much vitamin C and even fewer calories (and click here to learn about the <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/vitamins-youre-not-getting-enough-of">Vitamins You're Not Getting Enough Of</a>)::</p><ul>
<li>Papaya, ¾ cup, 50 calories</li>
<li>Brussel’s sprouts, 1 cup, 40 calories</li>
<li>Strawberries, 7 large fruit, 40 calories</li>
<li>Broccoli, ½ stalk, 25 calories</li>
<li>Red Bell Pepper, ½ medium pepper, 20 calories</li>
</ul><h2 id="16-comfort-food-chases-away-the-blues">16. Comfort food chases away the blues</h2><p>A bowl of tomato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich on a cold winter’s day. A big spoonful of mac & cheese when you’re down on your luck. Comfort food just makes you feel better, doesn’t it?</p><p>Actually, it doesn’t. In a 2014 study in the journal <em>Health Psychology</em>, aptly titled “The Myth of Comfort Food,” researchers showed participants depressing films to “induce a negative effect.” Then they gave them either comfort food, foods that weren’t considered comfort foods, or no food at all. Result: The subjects got over their bad moods in equal time, regardless of whether or not they ate. Is feeling bad a good excuse for eating bad? Turns out, it’s not. Cheer up—and start slimming down.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/948357316/best-junk-food-weight-loss-chips.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><h2 id="17-eating-junk-food-helps-battle-stress">17. Eating junk food helps battle stress</h2><p>You’ve been there: Stressed out and sprawled across your sofa with one arm elbow deep in a bag of cheese puffs. In the moment, it can be comforting, but a study published in the <em>British Journal of Psychiatry</em> found that people who consumed the most highly processed foods were 58 percent more likely to be depressed than those who ate the least. Your move: Find a healthy stress snack. Peanut butter and Triscuits do the trick, or check out the next myth.</p><h2 id="18-multi-grain-and-wheat-breads-are-better-than-white-bread">18. “Multi-grain” and “wheat” breads are better than white bread</h2><p>Wait a minute—isn’t “multi-grain” one of the biggest buzzwords in nutrition? And haven’t we been trained to pick the wheat bread over the white at every turn? Yes, but unfortunately those labels are about as credible as your local congressman’s campaign promises. “Wheat bread” is generally white bread with caramel or molasses added to make it look dark and healthy. “Multi-grain” just means that different kinds of junky refined grains may have been used. Always look for the words “100% whole wheat” or “100% whole grain” on the package—or choose one of these <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-best-brand-name-breads-weight-loss">10 Best Brand-Name Breads for Weight Loss</a>!</p><h2 id="19-wraps-are-healthier-than-regular-sandwiches">19. Wraps are healthier than regular sandwiches</h2><p>Those skinny little wraps are so flimsy, so delicate, so fusion-cuisine friendly. How can they not be better than the average lump of bread? Well, consider Subway’s wrap, for one. It packs 310 calories—before you even add the first whiff of meat or sauce. The reason is that, in order for the tortilla to wrap around like that, it needs added fat, often in the form of soybean oil and hydrogenated oils. (In fact, when ordering Mexican food, you’re usually better off with a hard taco than a soft, for the same reason.)</p><h2 id="20-potatoes-are-empty-carbs">20. Potatoes are empty carbs</h2><p>Once the proud spud stud of the American dinner plate, potatoes have been downgraded in recent years to a status not seen since the Irish blight. But unlike the commentators on cable news, the common taters in your kitchen actually have something worth chewing on. A USDA study of potatoes recently found levels of phytochemicals such as flavonoids and kukoamines that rival the amounts found in broccoli, spinach and Brussels sprouts. Kukoamines? You haven’t heard of them because they were previously believed to exist only in Chinese medicinal plants, but they have been shown to lower blood pressure by decreasing free-radical damage and inflammation.

Nutrition bars are actually nutritious</h2><p>In a world where we really called it as it is, nutrition bars would be known by another name: calorie bars. Most of them are so polluted with additives that their ingredients list looks like Charlie Sheen’s blood test results. For example, PowerBar Vanilla Crisp touts itself as “fuel for optimum performance,” but unless you’re talking about a performance by The Chemical Brothers, we’re not sure exactly what they mean. With four different types of sugar, it packs more of the white stuff than an adult woman should eat in an entire day. If you like the idea of a snackable bar that packs in the nutrition, read the ingredients carefully: Brands like KIND, Larabar, and Clif have plenty of smart offerings. But most of what’s out there is just candy.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/596159241/celery-even-more-nutrition-myths-busted.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><h2 id="22-celery-has-negative-calories">22. Celery has negative calories</h2><p>The idea of “negative calorie” foods is sexy. It’s popular. It even sounds cool. Snacking on celery? Not so! I’m actually losing weight! The theory is simple: Some foods have so few calories that the act of chewing and digesting them requires more energy than the body absorbs, resulting in a calorie deficit that leads to weight loss. Topping the “negative” list is the humble celery stick. At only 10 calories, much of the vegetable’s caloric content is bound up in cellulose, a fiber that passes through the the system undigested. In reality, it only takes a little more than half a calorie to digest a stalk. Moreover, a study published in <em>The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> suggests the thermic effect (the increase of metabolism after eating) may be even lower after high-fiber meals. Sure a celery stick is a wiser nutritional choice than say, a pretzel rod, but bottom line: if you’re eating, you’re consuming calories. And celery, or any other proclaimed “negative calorie” food isn’t a magic bullet for weight loss.</p><h2 id="23-nutrition-labels-are-always-factual">23. Nutrition labels are always factual</h2><p>How many calories does a 100-calorie pack of mini Oreos have? The answer’s not obvious. Nutrition facts labels are mandated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in accordance with the 1990 Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA). Unfortunately, they’re not always factual. In fact, the law allows a 20 percent margin of error for the stated value of calories and nutrients. In other words, your 100-calorie pack of mini Oreos could, theoretically (and legally), cost you 120 calories. One study in the journal <em>Obesity</em> that evaluated the “true” caloric content of 24 common food products found calories to be higher by an average of 4.3 percent. One popular snack’s carbohydrate content exceeded label statements by 7.7 percent according to the study. An investigative piece by the <em>New York Times</em>’ Calorie Detective found similar, unsettling results. Of the five everyday food items from chains like Subway, Starbucks and Chipotle that were sent a lab for testing, four had more calories than their labels reported—an excess adding up to 550 calories: enough to put on an extra pound of body weight in a week. Bottom line? Labels are a good guideline, but don’t obsess over calorie counting; if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p><h2 id="24-organic-produce-is-more-nutritious-than-conventional">24. Organic produce is more nutritious than conventional</h2><p>So you’re at the grocery store, and there they are: romaine hearts. They look great. And right next to them: organic romaine hearts. They look exactly the same, but they’re $1 more. Do organic fruits and vegetables actually provide a nutritional lift? Many naysayers will tell you “organic” is simply a marketing ploy and a wallet squeeze. A recent review in the <em>British Journal of Nutrition</em> did find substantially higher levels of antioxidants and lower levels of pesticides in organic produce compared with conventionally grown, but the study authors stop short of claiming that organic produce will lead to better health, and there are no peer-reviewed studies to support that claim. In fact, a similar well-cited analysis by Stanford scientists found very few differences in the nutritional content of organic and conventionally grown foods; the differences that do exist are so small, the authors say, that they’re unlikely to influence the health of the people who chose to buy (typically more expensive) organic foods. Bottom line for health experts? Buying organic fruits and vegetables may help you dodge pesticides (which can cause some tummy trouble), but there’s no convincing evidence (yet) that conventional and organic produce are different in nutritional composition.</p><h2 id="and-watch-to-discover-the-8-weight-loss-superfoods-you-ve-never-heard-of">AND WATCH TO DISCOVER THE 8 WEIGHT-LOSS SUPERFOODS YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF</h2><p/><div id="botr_0oob2Sx1_hclOjMCo_div"/><p/><script src="http://content.jwplatform.com/players/0oob2Sx1-hclOjMCo.js" type="text/javascript"/><p><br/></p><p><br/><br/><strong>MELT UP TO 10 POUNDS IN 7 DAYS!</strong> Test panelists lost up to 10 pounds in just 7 days—drinking delicious teas—with our best-selling <em>7-Day Flat-Belly Tea Cleanse</em>!

I was at <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/what-diet-experts-eat-mcdonalds">McDonald’s</a>, on a mission to try their new “Create Your Taste” burger machines, which allow customers to make the ultimate personalized sandwich by mixing and matching over 30 ingredients.

The kiosk, complete with a calorie counter, clocked the combination at 340 calories — but I was skeptical. That’s the same amount, according to the McDonald’s website, as an Artisan Roll BBQ Ranch Burger — a burger that packs bacon, cheese, tortilla strips and veggies on the same amount of meat as my creation. </p><p><img alt="create your taste lettuce wrap" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/169245964/create-your-taste.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><p>On the same machine, we layered two ⅓-pound patties inside an artisanal bun and dressed it up with Sriracha mayo, three orders of bacon, three orders of Pepper Jack Cheese, tortilla strips, jalapeños and an array of veggies — for a total of 790 calories. But if you had dreams of recreating the <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/worst-food-world-mcdonalds-custom-big-max-burger">Big Max Burger</a>—a 4-pound “Create Your Taste” kiosk creation that was filled with 10 orders of 16 different toppings—you’re out of luck. The machine only allows you to place three orders of each topping.</p><p><img alt="create your taste bacon burger" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/707066191/create-your-taste-bacon-burger-crop.jpg" class="img-responsive"/></p><p>The machine itself wasn’t that intuitive — it added pickles to my burger that I didn’t request — and an employee had to help us a number of times throughout the process. I paid for the <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/worst-burgers-in-america-2015">burgers</a>, a side of fries, a pack of apples and two drinks right at the machine (it cost a whopping $32.58) and then a McDonald’s employee directed us to a table.</p><p>“A waitress will be up with your order in a bit!” she said.</p><p>A waitress at McDonald’s? When no one had delivered our burgers 10 minutes later, I thought I might have heard her wrong. But after another five minutes, the food arrived in fancy pub-style metal baskets. Both meals were pretty delicious, a clear step up from the typical McDonald’s burger. Sadly, the savory <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/vegetarian-barbecue-survival-guide">grilled veggies</a> and admittedly less greasy burger patties weren’t good enough to be worth the extra wait. Sitting time and salty burgers aside, if I hadn’t known my lunch was from Mcdonald’s, I wouldn’t have been the wiser. </p><p>The biggest downside of the whole experience was the price, but it was an experience every Mickey D’s fan should try once. Currently, the burger kiosks are only at a few select McDonald’s in the U.S., but there are plans to expand the program to 2,000 U.S. locations—so keep your eyes peeled, McChefs!</p><p><br/></p>]]</content:encoded></item><item><title>Tricks for Boosting Your Weight Loss During Summer</title><link>http://www.eatthis.com/tricks-for-boosting-your-weight-loss-during-summer</link><description>Lose weight and burn fat during the hot months of summer without giving up warm weather favorites like beer and burgers.</description><pubDate>2015-08-08T10:32:25.000Z</pubDate><guid>55c390f0130000c30a4d32d1</guid><author>Eat This, Not That!</author><media:content url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/965685254/ground-beef-patties-toppings-xl.jpg type="image/jpeg"><media:thumbnail url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/965685254/ground-beef-patties-toppings-xl.jpg type="image/jpeg"><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="large-txt"><small><em>By Cecelia Smith</em></small></span></p><p><span class="large-txt">They’re called the lazy days of summer — and, boy, do our <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss">weight loss</a> goals agree.</span></p><p>In fact, while you may think of summer as a time for calorie-burning outdoor fun, research suggests otherwise. When temperatures soar, experts say levels of physical activity tend to plummet. Pair that with the beers at backyard barbecues and the mid-afternoon ice cream cones, and body weight inevitably creeps up. </p><p>But summer doesn’t have to be a desert barren of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/19-healthy-staples-for-weight-loss">weight loss foods</a>. There are a number of easy tweaks you can make to your diet that can improve your health and keep the summer pounds at bay — while you enjoy some of your warm weather favorites. Yes, even beer. Use these tricks, and you and your family can enjoy every lazy, hazy, dog day of the season — and still lose weight.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">1</div><div class="title">Buy the<br/> spicy salsa</div></div></div><p><img alt="salsa" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/942438854/spicy-salsa.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>Filling up on spicy food when you’re already sweating may sound counterintuitive, but scientists present a solid case for how culinary heat can help us beat the heat — and the bulge. They call it "gustatory facial sweating.” It’s a phenomenon that suggests spicy foods trigger special nerve receptors in our mouths and thermosensors in our stomachs that cause us to sweat — the body’s way of releasing heat via evaporative cooling. You’ll get the same heat-up-cool-down effect from a hot cup of tea, but spicy summer foods have the added benefit of being rich in capsaicin, a <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/8-best-fat-burning-foods">fat-burning</a> compound found in chili peppers.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">2</div><div class="title">Rethink your<br/> coffee order</div></div></div><p>It may be too hot for a steamy latte, but resist the urge to cool down with a flab-uccino—er, frozen, blended coffee beverage. In many instances, the cool equivalent of a hot espresso drink is far more caloric. Consider this typical <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/8-ways-slim-down-starbucks-order">Starbucks</a> order: A tall, nonfat Vanilla Latte will cost you 150 calories; but a tall, nonfat, no-whip Vanilla Frappuccino clocks in at 200 calories (it also serves up an additional 19 grams of sugar). That’s enough of a daily increase in calories to gain more than 1.25 pounds in three short months! Stay on track with your weight-loss goals this summer by sticking to iced coffee drinks instead. A tall, nonfat Iced Vanilla Latte at Starbucks is only 120 calories. And an Iced Coffee with nonfat milk and a shot of vanilla is a virtuous 80 calories.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">3</div><div class="title">Grow an <br/>herb garden</div></div></div><p><img alt="herb garden" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/171893044/herbs-windowsill.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>A DIY herb box is one of the most delicious ways to bring tons of fresh flavor to summer fare for minimal calories. And research suggests herbing-up with the aromatics can indeed help slim you down. One study in the journal <em>Flavour</em> found participants ate significantly less of a strongly-scented dish than an equicaloric, mildly scented version. Researchers suggest this sensory illusion triggers the release of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-most-filling-snacks">satiety</a> hormones, so you don’t over-indulge in something rich. And other research by the University of Utah suggests the simple act of tending to a herb box may keep the weight off. Female gardeners are, on average, 11 pounds lighter than their non-gardening peers while green-thumbed men are 16 pounds leaner, according to the study. Be sure to include parsley in your summer garden (or window box!). As a natural diuretic that helps flush excess water from the body, the herb is particularly <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-foods-for-your-beach-body">beach-body</a> friendly.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">4</div><div class="title">Sip on a [virgin]<br/> Bloody Mary</div></div></div><p>Tomato juice, as it’s loaded with lycopene and carotenoids, may be the best summer beverage for a hot beach bod and youthful <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/healthy-foods-that-give-you-glowing-skin">glowing skin</a>, new research suggests. Women who drank a small glass of tomato juice every day for eight weeks lost nearly an inch off their waistlines, independent of any other changes to diet or exercise, a recent trial published in the journal <em>Nutrition</em> found. Rehydrating after a day in the sun with a vegetable drink rich in carotenoids could also slash oxidation products–the main culprits of visible sun damage–50 percent more effectively than sodas, according to a separate two-week study.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">5</div><div class="title">Get your<br/> burger drunk</div></div></div><p><img alt="burger patties" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/965685254/ground-beef-patties-toppings.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>Throwing back a bottle of beer — into a marinade — may eliminate harmful chemicals that form when grilling meat at high temperatures, researchers say. In fact, marinating meat with beer for four hours lowered the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by as much as 68 percent in a recent study published in the <em>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry</em>. PAHs are known carcinogens and classified “<a href="http://www.eatthis.com/how-to-lose-man-boobs-by-avoiding-these-foods">endocrine disruptors</a>” that have been linked to obesity. Interestingly, the darker beers were the most powerful, but even a non-alcoholic variety reduced chemical formation by 25 percent. Previous research showed a red wine marinade to have a similar effect. Researchers say the antioxidant-rich marinades act like a barrier between the meat and cancer-causing compounds.

It’s true. People who ate more portions of brightly-colored produce had a healthier and more sun-kissed complexion than those who didn’t consume as much, a study in the <em>Journal Evolution and Human Behaviour</em> found. The faux glow is the result of disease-fighting compounds called carotenoids that give some fruit and veg their brilliant red-orange hue. Some of the best summer sources of the sunless stuff like carrots, bell peppers, and cantaloupe also happen to be particularly low-calorie, so you can snack to your heart’s (and belly’s!) content while you get your glow on. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">7</div><div class="title">Drown out<br/> the pounds</div></div></div><p><img alt="detox water" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/692715991/lemon-water-detox.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>Water is like fat-burning fuel: It’s what your <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/6-ways-to-boost-your-metabolism">metabolism</a> requires to function optimally, especially in the summer heat when we tend to lose water faster than normal. In fact, numerous studies have linked proper hydration — between half an ounce and an ounce of water for each pound you weigh — to improved weight loss. In fact, one study in <em>The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism</em> found drinking water (17 ounces) could increase fat-burning by 30 percent. Dehydration, on the other hand, slows calorie-burning. Make a summertime fetish of toting around a water bottle. Throw in a sliced lemon for good measure. Limonene, a compound found in the peel, is a great natural detoxifier, as it helps the liver to flush excess toxins from the system.   </p><p><br/><br/><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/MR/ETM/ETM_Yahoo_Mar15.jsp?cds_page_id=183370&cds_mag_code=ETM&id=1433344797224&lsid=51541019572027852&vid=1">DON’T DIET.

Blumberg</em></small></span></p><p><span class="large-txt">For many years, being a vegan in America was like being a Democrat in a red state. You just didn’t talk about it.</span></p><p>People assumed the differences between a vegan lifestyle and an omnivorous one were so big that debate-worthy fights would break out. But now science is stepping in as the moderator. While a recent study cited veganism as the <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/veganism-found-to-be-the-best-diet-for-weight-loss">most effective weight loss diet</a>, research also shows it’s possible — and beneficial — to have a moderate stance and diet. </p><p>Turns out, you don’t have to give up meat full-time to milk the health and <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss">weight loss</a> benefits of being a vegan. From scheduling Meatless Mondays to adopting Mark Bittman’s popular VB6 plan — in which you eat vegan until dinnertime each day — there are many ways to make a partially plant-based lifestyle work for you, all the while shedding weight — and keeping bacon on the menu. We wanted to know the best healthy eating and weight loss secrets (without giving up the occasional frozen pizza) so we tapped <a target="_blank" href="http://www.walnuts.org/resources/people/people/wendy-bazilian/">Wendy Bazilian, DrPH, RD</a>, and author of <em>The SuperFoodsRx Diet</em> for her top tips on working towards a more plant-based diet.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">1</div><div class="title">Add, don't<br/>subtract</div></div></div><p><img alt="plant based diet" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/844712155/fresh-vegetables.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>“Focus on adding fruits, veggies, beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains, tea, and water...not on reducing meat," Bazilian recommends. In the beginning, plant-based should simply mean “eat more plant foods.” An easy way to do this that Bazilian suggests is starting your meal with a soup or salad. “This ensures your meal features veggies, and it’s also a good strategy for slowing down the meal pace,” she explains. Spending more time over a healthy meal means your body has longer to register <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-most-filling-snacks">satiety</a> signals, so you’ll likely end up eating less overall.</p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Legumes are the smartest place to start if you want to ease into plant-based eating gently. You’ll not only pack plenty of protein into your diet but also ward off cravings by staying fuller for longer. Regular consumption of legumes can, in fact, make you feel 31% fuller than passing on the fiber-packed beans, one study found. It gets better: upping your <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-protein-powder-every-goal">plant-based protein</a> consumption may even play a role in preventing obesity, one study in <em>Nutrition Journal</em> found.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">2</div><div class="title">Don’t call this<br/> diet vegetarian</div></div></div><p>“While a person that follows a vegetarian diet likely also follows a <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/beyonce-vegan-food-delivery-service">plant-based diet</a>, you can be a meat, poultry or fish eater and still be plant-based in your approach,” says Bazilian. “Plant-based eating is inclusive—we all can benefit and have that in common, even if we differ on certain fine details,” she adds. Focusing on the delicious foods you can eat—rather than worrying about what you have to "give up"—ensures you'll stay plant-based longer. </p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Avoid the newbie mistake of trying to swap non-veg favorites for vegan <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-meat-alternatives-and-veggie-burger-for-rapid-weight-loss">meat alternatives</a>. Those vegan chicken nuggets can be loaded with nasty additives and sky-high amounts of sodium — and they probably won’t quench your hankering for the real deal. Try dabbling in ethnic cuisines, instead. Indian food offers spicy and filling curries, Japanese food boasts a dizzying array of weight-loss friendly seaweed salads and veggie sushi rolls and Mexican is great for diet-pleasing veggie fajitas and guacamole.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">3</div><div class="title">Take meat off the<br/> menu once a week</div></div></div><p><img alt="plant based weight loss secrets" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/366273516/root-veggies.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>It’s time to finally add <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/easy-protein-packed-meatless-monday-menu">Meatless Monday</a> to your schedule — any day of the week. If the start of your week is typically swamped and you know you won’t have time to plan ahead, simply choose another day. “Think about identifying one day each week where plant-foods are front and center at every meal, all day,” says Bazilian. An easy way to shift to plant-based food is to focus on a single type of change. Bazilian suggests trying Tofu Tuesday or even Fruit-Forward Friday. Get creative and try new approaches each week; even the once-a-week cut back on meat is good for your health, according to the Mayo Clinic.</p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Smart meal prep will help with your weight loss success. Over the weekend, try making a large batch of grains (like brown rice or quinoa) and a big batch of beans so you can quickly pull together <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/healthy-meals-you-can-order-at-any-mexican-restaurant">healthy meals</a> throughout the week.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">4</div><div class="title">Slip more nuts<br/> into your diet</div></div></div><p>Get to know how nuts fit into your diet beyond your mid-afternoon snack. Recent research shows they can be a boon for weight loss and they help ensure you’re getting enough protein when you’re cutting back on traditional, animal-based sources. Get creative and they’re easy to slip into your meals and snacks throughout the day. “Add a few walnuts to your morning oatmeal or your salad at lunch. Use nuts in a trail mix at snack time or as the coating for salmon or chicken or mixed in a bean-based burger or stir-fry at dinner,” suggests Bazilian. Don’t ax them from the office snack drawer, though, especially walnuts. This variety is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids and packs enough protein and fiber to keep you feeling fuller for longer, which is key when it comes to promoting efficient weight loss.</p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>If you’re a fan of snacking, we suggest picking up a package of pistachios, one of our favorite <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/25-best-protein-snacks">high-protein snacks</a>. Sometimes called the “skinny nut,” they earn their nickname by packing only 100 calories into a generous 30-nut serving. Make sure you look for unsalted varieties to avoid bloat. Pro-tip: If you accidentally picked up the salted variety and are in a pinch, give the nuts a quick rinse to slash some excess sodium.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">5</div><div class="title">Befriend herbs<br/> and spices</div></div></div><p><img alt="weight loss secrets" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/226112233/chili-healthiest-spices-planet.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>When you tell someone you’re on a “plant-based diet,” they’re far more likely to think “tofu steak” than “chickpea curry.” Vegan and vegetarian diets have a reputation for being, well, less than spicy — a reputation that’s entirely unwarranted. Your best friends in the battle against bland tofu: herbs and spices. “They are plants and they are flavor! That’s a win-win,” says Bazilian. Sure, a meat-centric diet can boast satisfying umami, but much of that comes from fat and sodium-laced marinades and sauces — recipe additions that can add inches to your waist. Herbs and spices, on the other hand, are low on calories, but high in flavor; they help transform a blah meal without packing on pounds like a cheese sauce or fattening dressing would. To get started, try a handful of mint in your morning <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-smoothie-recipes-weight-loss">weight loss smoothie</a> to wake up your taste buds, or a generous sprinkle of fat-burning cayenne pepper on a stir-fry. </p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Put the <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/5-best-spices-to-burn-fat">best spices</a> for weight loss front and center on your spice rack so they become your go-tos when cooking. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">6</div><div class="title">Rethink how<br/> you food shop</div></div></div><p>There’s no disputing that the produce section should be your primary stop at the supermarket, but there’s no reason to skip the other aisles entirely. Canned, jarred and frozen foods are all fair game and can bolster your daily diet as long as you follow this simple tip from Bazilian: look for products that use whole foods and have short and simple ingredient lists. Also challenge yourself to think creatively about how you update your regular grocery store routine. Instead of meat, look for vegan hits of umami flavor like kalamata olives, mushrooms and miso paste, all of which can enhance whole-grain pasta dishes or liven up bean- and tofu-based meals. In addition to eating healthier and promoting your weight loss goals, you’ll also probably see your bill go down without the expense of meat, fish and dairy.</p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>When starting out on a plant-based diet, make a pact to try one new food each week. Vegan eating has no shortage of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-best-foods-rapid-weight-loss">weight loss foods</a> to slip into meals. Start by challenging yourself with staples like protein-dense seitan. You’ll slowly broaden your culinary comfort zone without having to worry about unused food going to waste.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">7</div><div class="title">Keep it<br/> simple</div></div></div><p><img alt="plant based weight loss secrets" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/142776095/grilled-vegetables.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/>Save the pressure cooking for your crockpot, and take it easy on yourself as you change your diet. Bazilian warns against overthinking the changes or trying to overhaul your whole diet. “Take simple steps toward more plant-based foods in your day,” she suggests. That can be as simple as replacing your afternoon snack of Greek yogurt and a piece of fruit with almond butter toast with sliced banana or just slipping more greens onto your dinner plate. Work on making little tweaks to your daily diet until they become a habit. Then move on to another small change.</p><h3 id="-eat-this-tip-"><strong>Eat This!

Research shows that by adding <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/8-fatty-foods-make-you-skinny">healthy fats</a> like avocado to produce-rich dishes like salad, you can boost your body’s absorption of the nutrients available. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">3</div><div class="title">Pinto<br/> Beans</div></div></div><p><strong>Serving:</strong> 1 cup, 243 calories, 23% DV potassium</p><p>Beans, beans, they’re good for your heart—and also your skinny jeans. Legumes like pinto beans are an inexpensive, virtually fat-free source of potassium, protein and gut-filling fiber. One half-cup of beans provides your body with about seven grams of easy-to-assimilate protein—equal to the amount in about one ounce of chicken. The protein content combined with the high dosage of fiber will help slow digestion and work to stabilize blood sugar. As a result, pinto beans can help prevent unhealthy <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/8-daily-habits-prevent-cravings">cravings</a> and encourage regular, healthy bowel movements, which will translate into a slimmer, healthier you. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">4</div><div class="title">Cooked<br/> lentils</div></div></div><p><img alt="foods for potassium lentils" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/508522872/lentils.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/><strong>Serving:</strong> 1 cup, 230 calories, 21% DV potassium</p><p>Tiny, but mighty, these little legumes offer very similar benefits to beans. Thanks to the potassium content, lentils can help prevent your muscles from cramping up. They work even more to support muscle growth and development as a solid source of <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/grab-and-go-protein-shakes">plant-based protein</a>, which helps with muscle recovery after tough workouts. Also, if you tend to be a bit impatient in the kitchen, know that lentils cook more quickly than beans, making them a more convenient choice for those nights when you just don’t have the time. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">5</div><div class="title">Cooked<br/> beets</div></div></div><p><strong>Serving:</strong> 1 cup, 75 calories, 15% DV potassium</p><p>They’re underground and underdogs—the veggie often least bought. But beets are low in calories, high in fiber and rich in the mineral iron. Like potassium, iron is another mineral that is crucial for proper <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/4-foods-fuel-best-workout-ever">muscle function</a> because it boosts blood flow to your muscles, increasing their efficiency. And they’re not hard to cook. Trim both ends of the beet, toss in a small amount of olive oil and roast at 450 degrees F until tender. Then slice and pair them with some mint and goat cheese as a small salad, or as a side to a lean meat dish. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">6</div><div class="title">Fresh<br/> figs</div></div></div><p><img alt="foods for potassium figs" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/276463814/figs.jpg" class="img-responsive"/><br/><strong>Serving:</strong> 8 ounces, 168 calories, 15% DV potassium</p><p>No, not Fig Newtons. Figs—fresh figs. While they may not help you get ripped, the nutrients they contain, including potassium, help your muscles work. They’re also a great source of fiber, which will help slow <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/foods-that-cause-bloating-and-hurt-digestion">digestion</a> and keep you feeling fuller, longer. Do resist going for the dried version though, since the sugar skyrockets. For the tastiest figs, stock up between June and September when they’re in season. </p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">7</div><div class="title">Cooked<br/> Brussels sprouts</div></div></div><p><strong>Serving:</strong> 1 cup, 60 calories, 14% DV potassium</p><p>They’re the go-to joke—every child’s worst nightmare—but avoiding them now would be, well, childish. Besides the potassium, they encourage weight loss as a high-fiber, <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/fast-food-meals-under-350-calories">low-calorie food</a>.

Juicy, light and extremely high in water content, the melon is hydrating, with potassium an added workout bonus. The fruit is also particularly low in calories. Next time you think your store-bought fruit salad has just a bit too much, dig in instead.</p><div class="number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone"><div class="header-mod"><div class="number">9</div><div class="title">Banana</div></div></div><p><strong>Serving:</strong> 1 medium, 108 calories, 13% DV potassium</p><p>Well, we couldn’t <em>not</em> include them! Trainers and fit-minded folks go ape over this nearly-perfect pre and post-workout fruit, and they’re right to do so. One banana clocks in at only 108 calories, and can give you just enough energy (thanks to the carbohydrates) to get through your workout without being weighed down by, say, a <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/10-protein-shake-recipes-weight-loss">protein shake</a>. They’re also a great source of fiber and naturally a little sweet, so they’ll fill you up and satisfy sweet cravings the healthy way.

However, these juicy fruits are worth adding to your meal, for a more toned, healthy body. At less than 40 per one cup serving, they’ve got potassium, but are probably best known as an incredibly potent source of lycopene, a powerful antioxidant that promotes healthier, <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/7-foods-fix-biggest-beauty-problems">younger looking skin</a> and may also fight against some types of cancer.

After all, you’re swapping fat- and hormone-laden meats for the natural gifts from Mother Earth.</span> </p><p>But it’s not that simple. Most packaged vegetarian foods are made for newcomers to vegetarianism — or people who haven’t quite mastered the art of plant-based cooking. So while eating a plant-based diet is healthy (many studies have found a relationship between vegetarian diets and longer life), eating a lot of processed “vegetarian” foods—as opposed to actual vegetables—isn’t always the best option. The majority of meat substitutes are nothing more than disks of water mixed with chemicals and salt—not what you want to be eating if <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/best-fruits-for-total-health-and-weight-loss">total health</a> and <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss">weight loss</a> is your goal. </p><p>But fear not veggie-lovers, turning to a veggie burger or faux chicken strip when you’re in a pinch doesn’t have to throw an otherwise healthy diet off track.

Soy is high in naturally occurring chemicals called phytoestrogens, which may influence our hormones and lead to weight gain if consumed in excess. However, more research on the effects of phytoestrogen is needed before we can draw any definitive conclusions.</p><p/></div></div></div><h2 id="best-bean-based-burger">BEST BEAN-BASED BURGER</h2><div data-edit-number="5" class="module-edit"><div class="bestworst-mod2"><h3 class="mobile-head">Sunshine Burger Loco Chipotle Veggie Burgers</h3><div class="compare-mod"><div class="img-container"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/564659548/meat-alt-loco-chipotle-box.jpg"/><div class="cover positive"><p>Eat This!</p></div></div><h3><p>Sunshine Burger Loco Chipotle Veggie Burgers, 1 burger</p></h3><table class="mod-table"><tbody><tr><td><p>Calories</p></td><td><p>300</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fat</p></td><td><p>16 g</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Saturated Fat</p></td><td><p>2 g</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sodium</p></td><td><p>320 mg</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Carbs</p></td><td><p>27 g</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fiber</p></td><td><p>9 g</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sugar</p></td><td><p>3 g</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Protein</p></td><td><p>12 g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="bestworst-content"><h3 class="desk-head">Sunshine Burger Loco Chipotle Veggie Burgers</h3><p/><p>If your go-to veggie burger often leaves your stomach begging for more, Sunshine Burger’s Loco Chipotle Veggie Burgers are about to become your new BFF.

However, the earthy blend of garlic, dill and kale is extremely tasty without being overpowering. If you like the taste of ranch dip, you’ll likely be a fan of these, too. The best part: They don’t have a lingering aftertaste like we thought they might. We could easily polish off an entire bag of these in seconds—and not just because of their bite-sized pieces.</p><p><strong>Eat This! Because:</strong> These Kool Ranch Kale Chips are not only lower in calories and fat than Doritos but also serve up impressive amounts of two essential vitamins. These crunchy snacks deliver 55 percent of the day’s immunity-boosting vitamin A and a whopping 300 percent of the day’s vitamin K, a nutrient that helps blood clot. If you have trouble forcing yourself to eat leafy greens prepared other ways, this could be a way to reap some of the health-boosting benefits.</p><p><strong>Best Way to Eat It:</strong> Straight out of the bag. Because it’s both nutritious and non-perishable, these kale chips make for a great <a href="http://www.eatthis.com/50-best-healthy-snacks-for-weight-loss">healthy snack</a> for road trips or office cubicles. Throw them in a glove box or desk drawer, so you’ll be prepared with something nutritious whenever hunger strikes.</p><p><strong>Secret Ingredient:</strong> Unlike traditional chemical-laden chips, Rhythm uses fresh lemon juice, dill weed and garlic to flavor their organic kale—and it’s evident every time you take a bite.</p><p><strong>Nutritionals:</strong> Per 1-ounce (28 grams) serving: 140 calories, 7 g fat, 0.5 g saturated fat, 220 mg sodium, 13 g carbs, 4 g fiber, 3 g sugar, 6 g protein</p><p><br/><br/><strong><a target="_blank
