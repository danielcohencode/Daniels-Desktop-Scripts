Markdown Validator Script
	install Node.js
	Install node csv-parse package
	Install node valid url package (future rollout)
	Download scripts from Github
	Scripts must be in the same folder to work (best to use a copy outside the repo)
	.csv’s and .txt’s should optimally be housed closeby to the scripts (not necessary at all)
