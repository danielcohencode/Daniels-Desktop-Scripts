Thankfully, there’s another way.</span></p><p>Getting the body you’ve always wanted is as simple as sticking to a regular eating schedule and downing 16 ounces of H20 before digging into your meals — at least that’s what two recent studies suggest. </p><p>For the first study, which focused on eating schedules, researchers examined the dining habits of college students. They found that those who regularly sat down to breakfast and dinner had overall better diets than those who ate more sporadically. In the study, scheduled eaters consumed less fast food, fewer <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/how-much-sugar-in-your-favorite-sugary-drinks\">sugary drinks</a> and more fresh produce than their less regimented counterparts — and these dining habits greatly impact weight. But there’s an easy way to boost your slim-down success even further, and that’s where the water comes in.</p><p>Sipping 16 ounces of water before each meal could lead to significant weight loss, according to a recent <em>Obesity</em> study. To come to this finding, researchers rounded up 84 obese adults for a 12-week experiment. After all of the participants received general weight loss advice, they were assigned to one of two groups. The first group was told to drink 16 ounces of water half an hour before each of their meals while the other group was told to imagine that they were already full before digging in. At the end of the study, the water group had lost about 9 pounds while their less hydrated peers shed about three pounds less. The researchers say that drinking H20 before meals is an effective weight loss strategy because it helps increase satiety, which makes it easier to dine smart. </p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>During the week, wake up 30 minutes early to ensure you have time to sit down to a filling, <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/eat-this-not-that-quick-healthy-breakfast\">healthy breakfast</a>. And over the weekend, <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/meal-prep-ideas-for-every-weight-loss-diet\">prep a week's worth of dinners</a> so you always have something nutritious to eat whether you're dining at your desk or your dinner table.

How do you figure out whether you’re paying too much for a cup of coffee (especially if you haven’t had your morning coffee yet)? </p><p>From “fair trade” to “shade grown” to the omnipresent “morning blend,” the editors of <em>Eat This, Not That!</em> decoded the industry jargon to make sure you’re getting your money’s worth. Read on below, and learn the other ways food marketers may be hoodwinking you with these <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/29-nutrition-myths-busted\">24 Biggest Nutrition Myths—Busted</a>!</p><h2 id=\"the-claim-100-arabica-beans\">THE CLAIM: 100% Arabica Beans</h2><p><strong>THE TRUTH:</strong> Coffee beans come in two main varieties: arabica and robusta. Of the two, arabica beans deliver the most complex flavors, but because they’re more difficult to grow—i.e., more expensive—commercial roasters such as Folgers often fill out their blends with cheap robusta beans. That makes for a cup with big body but low acid, which means it’s heavy in the mouth but not particularly interesting to the tongue. Small-scale craft roasters don’t generally bother putting this information on the bag, but that’s fine considering most of them wouldn’t dare to pollute their coffee with robustas. </p><p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong> When you’re shopping the commercial blends in the supermarket, look for brands that boast they’re 100% Arabica. And when hunger strikes, pair your coffee with cookies, crackers or other healthy choice from this brand-new list of <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/50-best-healthy-snacks-for-weight-loss\">The 50 Most Delicious Brand-Name Snacks</a>! </p><h2 id=\"the-claim-fair-trade-certified\">THE CLAIM: Fair Trade Certified</h2><p><strong>THE TRUTH:</strong> Much of the world’s coffee is grown in impoverished countries where farmers struggle to feed their families, and fair trade certification is the cooperative effort to change this. Right now that means US importers pay farmers no less than $1.35 per pound of conventional coffee and $1.51 per pound of organic. That would have been huge in 2001 when the year’s average was $.46 per pound, but today the average farmer sells at more than $1.20, according to the International Coffee Organization. Furthermore, some journalists have uncovered instances where fair trade farmers were making less than the minimum wage set by their government, and some economists argue that the artificial price floor creates a surplus for fair trade coffee that ultimately drives down the price of noncertified beans. </p><p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong> Most fair trade coffee is also organic, and many struggling farmers have improved their lives by working with fair trade organizations.</p><h2 id=\"the-claim-organic\">THE CLAIM: Organic</h2><p><strong>THE TRUTH:</strong> Organic coffee, so long as it bears the official logo of the USDA, falls under the same governmental regulation as organic produce, which tells you that the coffee has been grown, transported, and roasted without the use of herbicides or pesticides. Unfortunately, no major studies have looked at how this affects your health, but there’s no question about organic’s impact on the environment. Chemical-reliant farming methods have been linked to fish deaths along the coasts of coffee-growing communities, and pesticides in water raise the concern for long-term health problems for locals. For organic beans you’ll likely pay a premium—generally about 25 percent more. Some of that trickles down to the farmer, but a wave of Latin coffee growers, for example, have been abandoning organic beans because they can’t recoup the extra expenses. </p><p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong> Buy organic because you don’t like pesticides, but not necessarily because the farmer will see more of that extra cash you shell out. And learn which organic foods are worth the $$$ with this list of <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-healthy-packaged-snacks\">14 Best “Clean” Packaged Foods</a>!</p><h2 id=\"the-claim-shade-grown\">THE CLAIM: Shade Grown</h2><p><strong>THE TRUTH:</strong> A common practice in coffee farming is to clear off the native trees to make room for more coffee trees, destroying natural biodiversity and creating monocultures that rely on pesticides and fertilizers to produce beans. So in theory, “shade grown” is supposed to tell you that a diverse ecosystem still thrives on the farm. The problem is that there’s no organization governing the term, which leaves it open to abuse by any farmer whose farm has a few lonely trees scattered about. </p><p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong> For environmentally meaningful certification, look for “Bird Friendly” and “Rainforest Alliance Certified” stamps.</p><h2 id=\"the-claim-morning-blend\">THE CLAIM: Morning Blend</h2><p><strong>THE TRUTH:</strong> A blend is simply a mix of beans from at least two different regions, and a “morning blend” is whatever that particular roaster thought you might enjoy at the start of the day. In contrast with blends are the single-origin coffees, which are identified simply by their place of origin: Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, or whatever the case may be. Presumably the goal with blending is to create a better-tasting cup, but often that’s not the case. Some roasters blend to bury the mistakes of flawed beans, and many connoisseurs find the pure flavors of single-origin coffee more satisfying than blends. And get this: When Consumer Reports recently rated 37 popular blends from places such as Starbucks, Peets, Caribou, and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, not one of them was considered good enough to earn the top scores of “excellent” or “very good.”</p><p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong> Skip it, and find your favorite single-origin cup. And to lose weight before you even rise and shine, read this science-backed list of the <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/14-ways-wake-up-with-zero-belly\">14 Ways to Wake Up With Zero Belly</a>!</p><h2 id=\"the-claim-rainforest-alliance-certified\">THE CLAIM: Rainforest Alliance Certified</h2><p><strong>THE TRUTH:</strong> Rainforest Alliance Certified must meet a strict set of requirements that promote sustainable resource management and the preservation of healthy ecosystems. That means farms must be partially covered by native trees, farmers must make living wages, and farming methods must have a minimal impact on the natural environment. The only designation more meaningful than the Rainforest Alliance Certification is the Bird Friendly stamp. Bird Friendly coffees have similarly strict eco standards, but they require the farm to also be certified organic, whereas the Rainforest Alliance allows the use of some chemicals.</p><p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong> Buy it, and help to make a difference.</p><p><br/><br/><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/MR/ETM/ETM_Yahoo_Mar15.jsp?cds_page_id=183370&amp;cds_mag_code=ETM&amp;id=1433344797224&amp;lsid=51541019572027852&amp;vid=1\">DON’T DIET.

If you pick the right foods and combination of nutrients, you’re bound to see results. But with so many variables at play — carbs, fats and proteins — it can be hard to piece together the ideal plate.</p><p>To ensure you don’t cancel out the better body benefits of your workout, follow our guide below. Doing so will help you create tasty post-workout meals that will give you the body you want — no matter what time of day you hit the gym.</p><p><img alt=\"post workout meal protein\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/358076270/various-protein.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><h2 id=\"pick-a-protein\">PICK A PROTEIN</h2><p>The body uses protein to repair and rebuild the muscles that were broken down as a result of your workout. That’s why it plays such a vital role in muscle building and weight loss. The more muscle you have, the more calories your body will burn at rest.</p><p><strong>Our Go-Tos:</strong> We’re fans of grilled and roasted poultry, eggs, milk, yogurt, fish (these are our <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/6-best-fish-for-weight-loss\">six favorites</a>), lean cuts of pork and <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-cuts-of-beef-for-weight-loss\">grass-fed beef</a>. If you’re a vegetarian or a vegan, be sure to consume these plant sources of <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/lose-weight-build-muscle-with-complete-proteins\">complete protein</a>, which contain all nine essential amino acids the body cannot produce on its own. Soybeans, chia seeds and hummus made with tahini all fit the bill.</p><p><strong>How Much:</strong> After you’ve picked your <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/how-much-protein-do-you-need-on-your-weight-loss-diet-plan\">protein</a>, measure out a serving that supplies about 20 grams of the muscle-building nutrient. (That’s what you’d find in three eggs or a 3-ounce serving of wild salmon or chicken.) Compared to consuming both larger and smaller amounts of protein, 20 grams most effectively fuels muscle repair after a workout, research shows. Noshing on more won’t hurt the cause — but it won’t help, either.</p><h2 id=\"boost-the-carb-count\">BOOST THE CARB COUNT</h2><p>To give you the energy you need to get through your spin class or weight room session, the body uses up stored carbohydrates called glycogen. It’s important to replenish these depleted stores to ensure you have enough gas left in the tank to fuel your daily activities and upcoming workouts</p><p><strong>Our Go-Tos:</strong> Eating fast-digesting carbs will jump-start the recovery process faster than slow-digesting complex carbs. But <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-complex-carbohydrates-to-eat-for-weight-loss\">complex carbs</a> tend to include more fiber, which can tame insatiable post-workout hunger. If you’ve had a lighter or shorter workout, stick with a complex carb. The fast-acting carbs aren’t necessary. </p><p>Slow-digesting carb we often reach for include: whole-grain and Ezekiel bread, black beans, quinoa and sweet potatoes. Fruit, corn tortillas, white rice and white potatoes are all easy-to-find sources of fast-acting carbs.</p><p><strong>How Much:</strong> After a workout, your body needs a meal with a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio of carbs to protein. If your workout went longer than an hour and a half, aim for the latter. If weight loss is your goal, go for the former. Since you’re aiming for 20 grams of protein, 20 to 40 grams of carbs will provide the proper nutrient ratio. But before loading your plate with pasta to hit that number, you’ll want to check your fat and protein sources for their carb counts and be sure to factor those numbers into your overall meal equation.</p><p><img alt=\"post workout meal healthy fats\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/643546389/foods-healthy-fats.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><h2 id=\"add-a-healthy-fat\">ADD A HEALTHY FAT</h2><p>There’s so much of a focus on consuming carbs and protein after a workout that many people overlook the importance of <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/8-best-fats-for-weight-loss\">healthy fats</a>. Consuming a source of the nutrient after the gym can enhance muscle growth, speed recovery time and reduce the risk of injury by protecting joints from wear, soreness and inflammation. </p><p><strong>How Much:</strong> A 1:1:1 or 2:1:1 ratio of carbs to protein to fat is ideal, so aim for 20 grams of healthy fat on your plate. But again, it doesn’t all need to come from an additional source. Chances are good your protein and carb sources will have a bit of fat. Be sure to consider that before overloading your meal with more.</p><p><strong>Our Go-Tos:</strong> There are lots of tasty ways to add a healthy source of fat to your meal. We’re partial to all-natural nut butter and coconut, olive and flaxseed oils. Avocado and lightly salted almonds are also healthy dish additions and contain many of the <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/healthy-food-better-for-hydration-than-gatorade\">electrolytes</a> lost through sweat during exercise. </p><h2 id=\"fill-your-glass\">FILL YOUR GLASS</h2><p>To stay cool during workouts, the body releases water in the form of sweat. It’s important to replenish the lost water to ensure you don’t become dehydrated.</p><p><strong>How Much:</strong> <em>Extreme Weight Loss</em> contestants drink 32 ounces of fluid for every hour of exercise they complete, says trainer Chris Powell. We suggest following suit. If you had a particularly long or sweaty workout, ensure you’re hydrated enough by monitoring the color of your urine. If you’ve had enough to drink, it will be pale.</p><p><strong>Our Go-Tos:</strong> You may feel trendy with a bottle of vitamin-enhanced beverage (read: sugar water) in your hand, but we’re partial to plain ol’ H20. If that gets too dull for you, turn to <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/14-detox-waters-banish-bloat\">detox water</a> filled with hydrating fruits like oranges, watermelon and cantaloupe. Gulping down a sugary drink is counterproductive to weight loss.</p><h2 id=\"two-perfect-fitness-plates\">TWO PERFECT FITNESS PLATES</h2><p>Need some culinary inspiration? We’ve got your back.

Study authors attribute the T-boosting effects in part to capsaicin, a compound in chilies that previous research has associated with increased testosterone levels.

And total sperm count was about 34 percent higher among men who ate the most dark meat fish, like salmon and tuna, than men who ate the least amount of fish.

But done wrong, pain is sure to follow. For many, shakes have a stomach-churning downside — and we mean that literally. Drinking the stuff causes stomach pain and nausea in countless people and oddly enough, it’s not a problem that’s often discussed outside web forums. While trading tips with fellow gym rats online has its benefits, the best way to remedy the issue is to seek out the advice of an expert — and that’s exactly what we did. Here, what might be going wrong in your shaker bottle, plus, how to tweak your shake so that you're not left doubled-over in pain after you sip.</p><h2 id=\"you-re-overeager-to-refuel\">YOU’RE OVEREAGER TO REFUEL</h2><p>You might have heard that consuming <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/25-best-protein-snacks\">protein</a> after a workout is necessary for optimal recovery, and that’s true — but you don’t need to start sipping your shake the second you get off the squat rack. In fact, if you down a shake too soon after your workout, it’s bound to upset your stomach. This could make it harder for the body to absorb and utilize the shake’s nutrients, explains Cassie Bjork, RD, LD of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://healthysimplelife.com/\">Healthy Simple Life</a>.</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>“Wait thirty to sixty minutes after your workout before consuming a protein shake,” suggests Bjork. “This gives your body time to transition out of the workout-fueled ‘fight or flight’ mode and into ‘rest and digest’ mode, in which your body can efficiently absorb nutrients. That’s why this is such an effective way to prevent stomach pain,” explains Bjork. So take an extra ten minutes to cool down, take a shower, change and relax a bit before whipping up your shake. Your stomach and <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/how-to-make-protein-shakes-weight-loss-muscle-growth\">muscles</a> will thank you!</p><h2 id=\"you-re-sipping-sweeteners-inulin\">YOU’RE SIPPING SWEETENERS &amp; INULIN</h2><p>Artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols may make your protein powder tasty, but the body can’t absorb them very well. “Because they aren’t completely digested, they hang out in our intestines where they become fermented by colonic bacteria,” explains Bjork. “The by-products of fermentation include gastric distress, diarrhea, cramping, gas and bloating,” she adds. And that’s not the only cause of your uncomfortable side effects. “Inulin, a naturally occurring carbohydrate found in many fruits and vegetables, is sometimes added to protein supplements and is a prime offender of upset stomachs,” explains <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.isabelsmithnutrition.com\">Isabel Smith, MS, RD, CDN</a>.</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Chuck any product that contains inulin and steer clear of powders that contain <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/sugar-free-foods-arent-what-they-claim\">artificial sweeteners</a> like Splenda (sucralose), acesulfame potassium (acesulfame-K or AceK), aspartame or saccharin. You’ll also want to avoid sugar alcohols like erythritol, marital, sorbitol and xylitol. Too much to remember? These all-natural <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/vegan-protein-powder-lines-that-are-all-natural\">vegan protein powders</a> fit the bill. </p><h2 id=\"you-re-using-too-much-powder\">YOU’RE USING TOO MUCH POWDER</h2><p>If one scoop of protein is good, two or three is even better, right? Not in the least. “Protein is the most difficult macronutrient to digest, and because of that, consuming too much at once can cause indigestion,” says Bjork. And you’re not just getting more protein in those extra scoops, you’re also getting additional carbs that will turn into sugar the instant they hit the bloodstream. “This can lead to nausea due to the blood sugar spikes and drops,” Bjork explains.</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Post-workout, Bjork recommends that women consume between 20 and 25 grams of protein. Men should aim for 30 to 35. She also recommends blending avocado, coconut milk, coconut oil, or your favorite nut butter into your <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-protein-powder-every-goal\">protein shake</a> to slow the absorption of the carbohydrates. Adding one of these healthy fats will help ward off nausea and sugar cravings. </p><h2 id=\"you-re-chugging-it-too-quickly\">YOU’RE CHUGGING IT TOO QUICKLY</h2><p>After a workout you’re totally starving —we get it. But knocking back your shake like you’re at a bar can make your stomach churn. “Eating too quickly can promote overeating and, in some cases, swallowing extra air, both of which can contribute to bloating and stomach upset,” says Smith.</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Nosh of a light <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-high-protein-foods-to-fuel-every-workout\">pre-workout snack</a> before hitting the gym so you aren’t famished after you’ve finished up.

Boosting daily <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/5-best-teas-that-boost-your-calorie-burn\">calorie burn</a> could be as simple as keeping up with the laundry.</span></p><p>Cardio can take many forms, like testing your rhythm in Zumba or chasing the beat at <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-foods-to-eat-before-and-after-soulcycle\">SoulCycle</a>. However, while you should absolutely include a few intense cardio sessions like dancing, spinning or boxing in your weekly routine to help increase your level of fitness and promote <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss\">weight loss</a>, there are sneaky ways to add more cardio minutes—or hours—into your overarching total. When it comes to weight loss, especially if you’re going after those final, stubborn pounds, every little bit makes a difference. Jim White, RD, ACSM HFS, Owner of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jimwhitefit.com/\">Jim White Fitness and Nutrition Studios</a>, shared a few tips on how to squeeze a little more movement into your day. </p><p>If you want to amp up your calorie burn, then it’s time to move it, move it—no sweaty gym clothes required. </p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">1</div><div class=\"title\">Clean</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"more cardio cleaning\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/892229992/cleaning-tub.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>Dusty counters and dirt-covered cars deserve your attention for more reasons than one. Sure, keeping the house clean and the car sparkling in the driveway can be great sources of pride (and keep your mother from lecturing you during family visits), but doing so also forces you to move around. “Keep those arms moving while washing your car or scrubbing that oven,” says White. Squatting to reach low corners and stretching to get higher ones recruits different muscles in the body to get the job done. Not to mention, it forces you to move a lot more than if you were sitting on the couch ignoring your chores. </p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">2</div><div class=\"title\">Shop</div></div></div><p>Carrie Bradshaw may have been onto something when she said shopping was her <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-weight-loss-exercises-in-the-world\">cardio</a>. “Constant walking around, standing in line and bending to pick up that shirt you accidentally dropped all burns extra calories,” says White. There’s no physical difference between walking on the treadmill and logging those steps in the mall — your body is going through the same motion. However, shopping fits more seamlessly into your day — and hey, you’ll probably knock quite a few tasks off your to-do list with the extra motivation to move. Even better, lugging around those shopping bags will make your arms work even harder, contributing to greater overall exertion. </p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">3</div><div class=\"title\">Move Your<br/> Conversation</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"more cardio talking on the phone\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/352035582/girl-cell-phone.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>Who says you have to sit down when you’re on the phone? We have <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/6-ways-your-cell-phone-can-help-you-lose-weight\">cell phones</a> for a reason: so we can talk on the go! Pace back and forth in your kitchen, take the conversation outside and walk around the block — whatever you do, just walk and talk. Though it may seem small, any movement added into your day is beneficial to your body. We already spend way too much time sitting at our desks, our dinner tables and the couch going about our business. Use phone calls as an excuse to get up and move around. Even better, you’ll be so invested in the conversation that you’ll have no idea that you’re getting a little bonus exercise. </p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">4</div><div class=\"title\">Get<br/> Up</div></div></div><p>Sitting for extended periods of time wreaks havoc on your <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-fruits-for-total-health-and-weight-loss\">total health</a>. Our bodies were made to be in motion, so give yours a little extra help by simply standing up. “Stand when possible at work. Research has shown that standing burns more calories than sitting, even standing still,” says White. Your body has to work to hold itself up because it has nothing supporting it. As a result, you burn more calories. </p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">5</div><div class=\"title\">Go Out<br/> For Lunch</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"more cardio lunchtime walk\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/998617799/friends-walking.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>You don’t need to <em>eat out</em> to <em>go out</em> for lunch. Instead of buying lunch or taking your lunch to go, eat at your desk and then go for a walk on your midday break. Taking a brisk stroll in the afternoon will not only give you a mental break but also help alleviate stiffness, get blood flowing and make your body work a little harder. Even just 15 minutes around the block will tack on some extra cardio to your daily total and bring you closer to your fitness goals. Every little bit adds up. For added burn, take the route that has more hills or inclines to challenge your legs a little more.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">6</div><div class=\"title\">Fidget</div></div></div><p>If you’re one of those people that can’t sit still, don’t worry about it. Though your fidgeting may bother your cubicle mates, you’re actually burning more calories than you would be sitting completely still. “Research by the Mayo Clinic determined that people who fidget burn up to 350 more calories per day,” says White. So tap that foot, bounce your leg and fiddle with your pen; doing so will increase your total cardio for the day.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">7</div><div class=\"title\">Cut the <br/>Commercial</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"more cardio pushups\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/490226034/girl-doing-pushups.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>The best way to avoid those annoying commercials is to get up and walk away. “Walk around during commercial breaks in your favorite show. These breaks can easily add up to 20 minutes for an hour-long episode,” says White. Even if you’re just walking in circles around your living room, your body is in motion and, therefore, burning more calories. If you’re feeling a little more adventurous, throw in some sit-ups or jumping jacks during commercial breaks, which will take that added cardio to the next level.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">8</div><div class=\"title\">Drink<br/> More</div></div></div><p>Sure, drinking water encourages weight loss in a number of ways, from filling you up, so you don’t overeat, to flushing your system of toxins and eliminating <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/8-food-remedies-for-bloating\">bloat</a>. Even better for your flat-belly goals, the more water you drink, the more trips to the bathroom you’ll have to take. Rather than looking at your constantly full bladder as a nuisance, see it as an opportunity to log more steps. Who’s to say you have to visit the same bathroom every time, too? If there are bathrooms on different floors in your office building, or even on opposite sides of your floor, take a trip to those occasionally. The farther you travel to the loo, the more calories and fat your body burns. </p><p><br/><br/><strong><a target=\"_blank\n\" href=\"http://www.zerobelly.com/\">LOSE UP TO 16 POUNDS IN 14 DAYS with <em>Zero Belly Diet</em>—the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling book from <em>Eat This, Not That!</em> author David Zinczenko.

Blumberg</em></small></span></p><p><span class=\"large-txt\">If you’re running for <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss\">weight loss</a>, read on for tips from world-renowned coach Eric Orton, well worth sprinting after.</span></p><p>When we prepared to interview Eric Orton—the shock-and-awe running coach who starred in Christopher McDougall's 2009 best-seller <em>Born to Run</em>, not to mention his own book, <em>The Cool Impossible</em>—we expected that he would offer tips way over our head. Boy, were we wrong. Just as adept at helping first-time runners lace up for the first time as he is at coaching ultramarathoners, Orton was happy to share quick and easy tips for losing weight while running, so you can (and <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/14-ways-lose-your-belly-14-days\">get that flat belly</a>) after lacing up.</p><p>Considering he once ran 36 hours (yes, hours), we’re gonna do whatever he says.</p><h2 id=\"be-strategic-when-you-hit-a-road-block-\">Be strategic when you hit a road block.</h2><p>When your weight loss efforts stall, Orton offers this smart advice: “If you’ve been hitting it hard, you either need to take a rest and recovery week of 50% of what your normal running log is for you,” he says. “Or, change up what you are doing and add more intensity and/or diversity to your running. This could be adding more running, longer runs, or as simple as adding in more intensity to one or two of your weekly runs.”  </p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-not-that-tip-\"><strong>Eat This, Not That! Tip</strong></h3><p>Remember to be gentle to yourself, he cautions, and celebrate your achievements. “When focusing on weight loss, the tendency can be to push too hard on all of your runs,” says Orton. “Understand that rest and recovery is when the body rebuilds and get stronger and during this recovery—easy running days or of days—is often when great weight loss occurs.” And make sure you fuel up right with these <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-high-protein-foods-to-fuel-every-workout\">pre-workout snacks</a> for every workout.</p><h2 id=\"focus-on-consistency-not-intensity-\">Focus on consistency, not intensity.</h2><p>Hey newbies—don’t make the mistake of putting the pedal to the metal every time. “Aim to make the majority of your weekly miles as easy as you can, so <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/the-most-popular-things-to-do-in-every-state\">running</a> is enjoyable,” says Orton. “Allowing you to achieve the consistency and frequency that is key for weight loss. Look to be consistent, focus on doing less, more often. Frequency is the key.” For example, he continues, “if you are used to running 3 times a week for 45 min, strive for 4-5 times per week at 20-30 minutes and build from there.”</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-not-that-tip-\"><strong>Eat This, Not That! Tip</strong></h3><p>When the time comes to make your runs more rigorous, try very short, faster efforts with walking or easy running breaks in between – rather than running steady and hard for a long period of time. “And when bumping up run intensity, look to do hill repeats or inclined intervals on the <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/7-exercise-fitness-mistakes-that-prevent-weight-loss\">treadmill</a>. The hills recruit more muscles than flat running and allows you to get in the important higher intensity with less impact,” Orton tells us.</p><h2 id=\"mix-up-your-movement-\">Mix up your movement.</h2><p>Think of running as a varied activity—rather than a one-note push—and you’ll lose weight faster. “You must continue to add challenge to your body,” says Orton. “Avoid doing the same type of running all of the time—change it up, to energize your workout and add an element of play and surprise.” This is why Orton set up his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.runningwitheric.com/page/jackson-hole-run-camps\">Jackson Hole Running Camp</a>. “This again puts focus on the activity and not on weight loss, and makes it much more sustainable and physically and emotionally rewarding.” </p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-not-that-tip-\"><strong>Eat This, Not That! Tip</strong></h3><p>If you typically do treadmill runs or the same lap at a gym or field, consider trail running: Running trails makes it feel like an adventure. Trail running is an amazing way to explore nature and makes running feel like an event in itself – not exercise.  There are also so many trail races of all distances that focuses more fun, adventure, and completion rather than finishing times and competition,” says Orton. Other creative ways to get running: try an exhilarating night run with friends, run as your commute to/from work (you’ll save money, too!), run to/from family or social commitments and challenge someone else to hit the pavement with you.</p><h2 id=\"train-smart-on-your-off-days-\">Train smart on your off days.</h2><p>To keep your body in optimal condition and weight loss steady on your breaks, Orton recommends incorporating bodyweight exercises with the use of a fit ball. “This not only trains for full-body strength but also helps the body to move better and keep your supporting muscles strong and active,” says Orton. (Don’t forget: muscle burns more calories than fat!) “Swimming is also an amazing cross-training activity that acts as a form of recovery—like a massage.”</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-not-that-tip-\"><strong>Eat This, Not That! Tip</strong></h3><p>Aside from swimming, try to spend time moving around in the water in all directions—arms, legs, whole body,” says Orton. Ready to turn up the heat? A rowing class might be your perfect match on off days since it complements full body strength as well, and works on your range of motion. Remember, too much jogging can be as bad for you as no exercise, so be sure to fit recovery days into your schedule. For a mental and physical workout, consider these <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/7-surprising-reasons-you-should-doing-yoga-now\">7 Surprising Reasons You Should Be Doing Yoga</a>!</p><h2 id=\"don-t-make-weight-loss-your-goal-\">Don’t make weight loss your goal.</h2><p>Sounds counterintuitive, but Orton advises: “When using running as a weight loss agent, create a long-term goal for your running so the focus becomes the running, rather than the weight loss.” Whether that’s doing a 5k fun run, running on your own for a month until you feel confident enough to join a group running club, or just making a lap around the football field, set your sights on tangible, running-related victories to set yourself up for success. </p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-not-that-tip-\"><strong>Eat This, Not That! Tip</strong></h3><p>To make sure you don’t stall once you crush your goal, be sure to create new goals by writing them down and putting a goal week to accomplish them by so you stay accountable to your next stepping stone.  </p><h2 id=\"sorry-folks-skip-the-music-\">Sorry folks, skip the music.</h2><p>Peace out, T Swizzle. We know you’re thinking that’s crazy (we did, too), but just hear Orton out. “I love music just as much as running, but very very rarely ever listen to music when I’m hitting the paths or concrete,” he says. “I do not think we should try and distract ourselves from running. This should be a time for the mind to become aware of the exercise and can be a very powerful time for self-reflection, personal discovery and even a creative time that can help with your career or passion projects. When I was writing my book, I would go for a run and think about my thoughts I wanted to convey and come home and write. This self-awareness also creates a &quot;flow&quot; in the brain, similar to the zone, but more predictable,” Orton explains.</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-not-that-tip-\"><strong>Eat This, Not That! Tip</strong></h3><p>To ease into it, try doing the last 10 minutes of your run—this is an especially good time because excitement is kicking in knowing you’ve almost made it—sans music. Once you’ve done that a few times, gradually increase how long you run without tunes until you feel ready to tackle  your whole run. “We should learn to enjoy our time when running and learn to ‘be with ourselves’, rather than focusing on ‘covering’ it up, and just hoping to get it over with.” Hey, at least those earbuds are one less thing you’ll have to worry about losing.</p><h2 id=\"surprise-don-t-worry-about-fancy-running-shoes-\">Surprise! Don’t worry about fancy running shoes.</h2><p>When we asked Orton what shoes he’d advise purchasing if you’re a running for weight loss regime, his answer surprised us. “[Before investing in a high end pair of shoes, my first] answer would be to focus more on building foot strength. The strength of our feet directly affects how well we move and run and activate other important running muscles.”  Focus on building foot strength by trying out some barefoot balance moves—first flat footed, and then balance with your heel lifted up. If you’re looking for more of a  challenge, Orton recommends finding a slant board at wobble board at the gym. “Building foot strength is such a simple act, but so very potent for you run health. Once you’ve devoted time to this, then simply find shoes that feel best for you.  As you develop better foot strength, gravitate to a shoe that has a flat bottom and thinner sole,” he says.</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-not-that-tip-\"><strong>Eat This, Not That! Tip</strong></h3><p>While we’re on the apparel topic, you might want to consider investing in a heart rate monitor: “Educate yourself on the use of a heart rate monitor so you can run at your own level of ability and intensity. This is key to help you continue to improve, lose weight and not over train,” says Orton. For shorter, “fitness” runs, Orton is a fan of a simple waist belt that allows you to carry one water bottle. We all know how important hydration is and even just touching a cold water bottle, can give you fuel to keep pushing when you feel like giving up. In terms of clothing, make sure you’re dressing for the demands of your regional weather. This will not only improve the enjoyment factor in your runs, but also make sure you can’t pull the “I have nothing to wear” card when weather gets in the way.</p>","author":"Eat This, Not That!","images":[{"title":"","description":"","author":"Eat This, Not That!","url":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/701953842/running-shoes-best-body-weight-workouts-xl.jpg","thumbnail":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/701953842/running-shoes-best-body-weight-workouts-xl.jpg"}],"date":{"published":"2015-08-23T08:10:46.000Z","updated":"2015-08-23T07:49:00.000Z"},"link":[{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.eatthis.com/best-tips-running-weight-loss"}],"relatedLinks":[[{"rel":"related","href":"http://www.eatthis.com/6-pain-free-ways-get-fit-30-seconds","thumbnail":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/980298903/steaming-tap-md.jpg","mediaType":"text/html","title":"6 Pain-Free Ways Get Fit in 30 Seconds","author":"Eat This, Not That!","description":"Real fitness isn’t about that 20 or 40 minutes you’re breaking a sweat.

But there are a lot of good things out there, and information is frequently updated by new studies, so it can be intimidating to know where to start. That’s why we’ve assembled the current weight-loss nutrient hall of fame.

Researchers found that administering arginine to obese women over 12 weeks resulted in a 7-cm average reduction in waist size and a 6.5-pound average weight loss, according to a recent study published in the <em>Journal of Dietary Supplements</em>. While that’s a welcome effect anytime, there’s a benefit to timing your dose: L-arginine consumed before a workout can help you burn more fat and carbs a separate study found.</p><p><strong>How to Get It:</strong> Almonds, which are a great <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-high-protein-foods-to-fuel-every-workout\">pre-workout snack</a>—grab a handful. Other great sources: Tofu, eggs, grass-fed beef, peanuts and walnuts.</p><h2 id=\"magnesium\">Magnesium</h2><p><strong>Why It’s Great:</strong> This essential mineral aids in hundreds body processes including muscle contraction, which improves protein synthesis. That, in turn, boosts fat burning. Higher magnesium intake was associated with lower levels of fasting glucose and insulin (factors that are related to fat storage and <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/4-surprising-foods-cause-weight-gain\">weight gain</a>) in a 2013 <em>Journal of Nutrition</em> study. Also, consuming magnesium helps boost lipolysis, a process in which your body releases fat from where it’s stored.</p><p><strong>How to Get It:</strong> Almonds, chard, cashews and spinach are rich in the nutrient.</p><p><img alt=\"essential nutrients potassium\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/388260100/banana-protein-shake.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><h2 id=\"potassium\">Potassium</h2><p><strong>Why It’s Great:</strong> Potassium helps flatten your belly in two ways: It aids recovery after a workout and helps the body flush out water and sodium, reducing bloat. It’s also crucial in maintaining healthy heart and kidney function, so seek it out. Only 4.7% of Americans consume adequate potassium, University of Illinois researchers found.</p><p><strong>How to Get It:</strong> Bananas get all the credit for this <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/9-best-flat-belly-superfoods\">flat-belly</a> nutrient, but molasses is actually the best food source according to the USDA. Add molasses, bananas, avocados, nuts and leafy green vegetables to your grocery list. </p><h2 id=\"resistant-starch\">Resistant starch</h2><p><strong>Why It’s Great:</strong> Also known as slow carbs, <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/how-to-lose-weight-eating-resistant-starch\">resistant starch</a> passes through the small intestine without being digested, feeding healthy <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-foods-for-gut-health\">gut bacteria</a> that helps you feel fuller longer and burn fat. In fact, replacing just 5 percent of the carbohydrates you consume each day with a source of resistant starch can boost fat burning after meals by up to 30 percent, one study found.</p><p><strong>How to Get It:</strong> Sweet potatoes, slightly green bananas, lentils and peas.</p><p><img alt=\"essential nutrients leucine\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/444256348/chicken-breast.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><h2 id=\"leucine\">Leucine</h2><p><strong>Why It’s Great:</strong> This amino acid is key to <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/10-perfect-muscle-building-foods\">muscle building</a> because it increases the body’s ability to synthesize protein. Researchers fed one group of people meals containing 10 grams of leucine per day, and another group a lower-leucine diet in studies conducted at the University of Illinois. In two studies, the groups that ate high-leucine diets lost the most weight and body fat, and maintained the most lean body mass. That’s key for keeping your metabolism humming as you drop pounds.</p><p><strong>How to Get It:</strong> Chicken is an excellent source; according to the USDA, a 6-ounce chicken breast contains about 4.4 grams of leucine per serving and 52 grams of protein. Other good sources include eggs, tofu, fish, beef and pork.</p><h2 id=\"omega-3-fatty-acids\">Omega-3 fatty acids</h2><p><strong>Why They’re Great:</strong> These fatty acids are famously excellent for your heart; they reduce the risk of arrhythmia, lower triglyceride levels and decrease blood pressure. And they’re no slouch when it comes to weight loss either, repairing inflammation and reducing <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/10-daily-habits-blast-belly-fat\">belly fat</a> storage. A fairly significant bonus: people with the highest blood levels of omega-3s lived an average of two years longer than those with lower levels, a study published in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> showed. </p><p><strong>How to Get Them:</strong> Wild salmon (make sure it’s wild, not farmed) and other oily fish, omega-3 eggs, grass-fed beef, walnuts and flaxseed oil</p><p><img alt=\"essential nutrients monounsaturated fats\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/595356835/superfoods-avocado.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><h2 id=\"monounsaturated-fats\">Monounsaturated fats</h2><p><strong>Why They’re Great:</strong> These healthy fats strengthen your heart, increase satiety and prevent the storage of belly flubber. A study in <em>Nutrition Journal</em> found that participants who ate half a fresh avocado with lunch — one of the best sources of good fats — reported a 40 percent decreased desire to eat for hours afterward. </p><p><strong>How to Get Them:</strong> Those aforementioned avocados, grass-fed beef, olive oil, coconut oil and dark chocolate</p><h2 id=\"vitamin-d\">Vitamin D</h2><p><strong>Why It’s Great:</strong> Aside from its well-publicized benefits like lowering the risk of cancer, the sunshine vitamin helps regulate hunger and appetite. And its importance in your <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/19-healthy-staples-for-weight-loss\">weight loss diet</a> shouldn’t be underestimated: a 2012 study found that supplementation with vitamin D was associated with a 7 percent decrease in fat! Another study from the University of Minnesota found a relationship between higher levels of D and fat loss, particularly in the belly area. </p><p><strong>How to Get It:</strong> Fish, eggs, and fortified dairy products will all help you get that <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/how-to-burn-fat-and-get-a-flat-stomach-without-going-to-the-gym\">flat stomach</a> you’re after.</p><p><img alt=\"essential nutrients choline\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/290905292/fried-egg-chives.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><h2 id=\"choline\">Choline</h2><p><strong>Why It’s Great:</strong> This fat-blasting B vitamin turns off the genes that cause your body to store fat around your liver. Studies have shown that dieters who eat eggs for breakfast, as opposed to high-carb meals such as bagels, lose weight faster because they’re less hungry.</p><p><strong>How to Get It:</strong> Eggs are the #1 food source — but you have to eat the yolk. Choline is also found in lean meats, seafood and collard greens.</p><p><br/><br/><strong><a target=\"_blank\n\" href=\"https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/NT/ETT/eat_this_not_that.jsp?cds_page_id=179628&amp;cds_mag_code=ETT&amp;id=1425531789444&amp;lsid=50632303094033617&amp;vid=1&amp;cds_response_key=W0115ET001\">FOR HUNDREDS MORE WEIGHT-LOSS IDEAS, click here for our new book <em>Eat This, Not That! 1,247 Awesome Slimming Swaps</em>.

In fact, researchers say snacks account for an extra 580 extra calories per day in our diets.</span></p><p>We love snacks so much, in fact, that more than half the country uses them as a meal replacement, according to a recent Nielsen report — and it’s not necessarily a bad thing. <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/50-best-healthy-snacks-for-weight-loss\">Healthy snacks</a> — especially high-protein, afternoon munchies — can curb appetite, improve diet quality and speed up <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss\">weight loss</a>, recent studies suggest. But the wrong snacks can pack on the pounds faster than you can rip open a bag of Doritos. And there’s the rub.</p><p>Finding a good-for-you mini-meal isn’t easy because, in the American food jungle, chips are the most popular snack food (followed by chocolate, cheese and cookies). So simply the selection process, here’s a list of the worst “healthy” snacks for weight loss, and the damage control tips you need to stay on track:</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">1</div><div class=\"title\">Plain<br/> rice cakes</div></div></div><p>Rice cakes are an old-school diet staple. But the simple carbohydrates rank notoriously high on the glycemic index (GI) — a measure of how quickly blood rises in response to food on a scale of one to 100 (rice cakes come in at 82). High GI foods provide a rush of energy, but can leave you hungry within a few hours. Researchers at the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center found high-GI snacks caused excessive hunger and increased activity in craving and reward area of the brain — the perfect storm for <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/10-healthy-foods-youre-overeating\">overeating</a> and <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/4-surprising-foods-cause-weight-gain\">weight gain</a>.</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>EAT THIS TIP</strong></h3><p>Adding healthy fats or protein to a meal lowers its glycemic load. Swap a two cake mini-meal for one rice cake topped with a generous swipe of nut butter. The combo will keep you fuller for longer and has the added benefit of being a complete protein with all nine essential amino acids.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">2</div><div class=\"title\">Dark chocolate<br/> chips</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"worst healthy snacks dark chocolate chips\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/901642112/chocolate-chips.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>Surely a few chocolate chips will satisfy your sweet tooth, right? Researchers aren’t so confident; people consume an average 41% more calories when snacking on unwrapped snacks, one study published in the journal <em>Appetite</em> showed. Researchers say peeling off a wrapper, or cracking the shell of a nut slows us down, which gives the body more time to send out “I’m full” signals. And the mounting pile of candy wrappers and nut shells serves as a visual reminder as to just how much we’ve eaten. </p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>EAT THIS TIP</strong></h3><p>Remember that “just a bite” still has calories, and we usually don’t stop at just one bite. While high-quality dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa) is the most waist-friendly choco choice, you may want to stick with a small portion of wrapped varieties over “hand to mouth&quot; chocolate chips.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">3</div><div class=\"title\">Roasted<br/> almonds</div></div></div><p>Sure, roasted nuts are delicious. But the high-heat cooking method does <em>nut'n</em> for your waistline. Raw almonds caused stomach acids to swell (in a good way) and were slower digesting than roasted almonds, creating a greater feeling of fullness that lasted longer, one study in the journal <em>Food Biophysics</em> showed. Moreover, store-bought varieties are often roasted in oil and then tossed in salt and preservatives. Emerald Nuts Dry Roasted Almonds may be oil-free, but you’ll find 18 other ingredients on the label, including monosodium glutamate (<a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/side-effects-of-msg-increased-appetite-weight-gain-and-more\">MSG</a>), a controversial flavor enhancer linked to weight gain in some studies.</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>EAT THIS TIP</strong></h3><p>Go raw or go home. Brownie points if you opt for in-shell varieties. Named &quot;The Pistachio Effect,&quot; research shows the act of shelling nuts can slow you down and give your body a chance to register fullness 86 calories sooner than you would otherwise.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">4</div><div class=\"title\">Gluten-Free<br/> Pretzels</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"worst healthy snacks pretzels\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/321810409/pretzels-bowl.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>For some people, eating gluten-free is a necessity. But for those who think &quot;gluten-free&quot; means weight loss-friendly, beware the health halo. A pretzel offers very little in the nutrition department — gluten-free, organic, or otherwise — and it’s easy to fall for the claims. In a recent study, people estimated snacks labeled “organic&quot; to be lower in calories, more nutritious and even tastier than when reviewing the same snacks without the &quot;organic&quot; label. Moreover, processed <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/15-best-gluten-free-snacks-for-weight-loss\">gluten-free snacks</a> are typically higher in carbohydrates and fats than regular varieties. Gluten-free Glutino pretzels, for example, have an additional 30 calories, five grams of fat and none of the fiber and protein of an equivalent portion of regular Rold Gold variety.</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>EAT THIS TIP</strong></h3><p>Don’t get it twisted: Pretzels are little more than flour and salt. Satisfy your salty, crunchy craving with a big bowl of air-popped popcorn instead. Three cups of the naturally gluten-free snack clock in at only 90 calories and count as a serving of waist-whittling whole grains.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">5</div><div class=\"title\">100-calorie<br/> packs</div></div></div><p>Reaching for a portion-controlled packet of crackers or cookies may sound like a good snack strategy for weight loss, but the mini-packs may fill you out before they fill you up, research suggests. In fact, dieters perceived small snacks in small packages as diet-friendly and ended up eating multiple packets and more calories overall than when given a regular-size package, a recent study in the <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em> found.</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>EAT THIS TIP</strong></h3><p>When dieting, you’re better off serving yourself a small portion from a regular-sized bag than falling for the allure of a minipack, study authors suggest. </p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">6</div><div class=\"title\">Fruit<br/> smoothies</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"worst healthy snacks fruit smoothies\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/603047982/fruit-smoothies.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>A <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/only-smoothies-you'll-need-video\">fruit smoothie</a> sounds like a virtuous choice for an afternoon pick-me-up, but be forewarned: Many store-bought options are blended with high-calorie dairy bases and cheap sweeteners that make them more dessert-like than diet-friendly. A small Baskin Robbins Mango Banana Smoothie packs 440 calories, nearly a third of what the average woman on a 1500-calorie weight loss diet needs in an entire day. Not to mention 96 grams of sugar — that’s more than you’ll find in 7 scoops of the chain's Rainbow Sherbet. Adding insult to injury, banana doesn’t feature once on the ingredients list. </p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>EAT THIS TIP</strong></h3><p>If you’re hankering for something sweet and fruity, nothing beats a whole piece (or two!) of the real thing. In fact, a recent study in the journal <em>Nature</em> found liquid carbohydrates to be 17 percent less filling compared with solid carbohydrates. As a general rule: eat, don’t drink, your fruits. And if it’s creamy that you’re craving, pair your fruit with a cup of low-fat plain cottage cheese or yogurt. A recent study found <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/25-best-protein-snacks\">high-protein snacks</a> eaten in the afternoon can improve appetite control and diet quality. </p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">7</div><div class=\"title\">Granola</div></div></div><p>What happens when you take a bowl of oats, drown them in oil, cover them with sugar, bake them on a cookie tray? You get your average granola: highly delicious, highly caloric, highly likely to put you over your daily calorie budget in just one serving — and chances are you’ll munch through far more than a scant half-cup that makes up a single serving. In fact, a recent study found people served themselves the same volume of cereal regardless of caloric value. In other words, you’re likely to pour the same amount of granola into a bowl as you would corn flakes, and consume five times the calories in the process.</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>EAT THIS TIP</strong></h3><p>A big bowl of oatmeal topped with fresh fruit will fill you up for a fraction of the calories and fat as a small portion of energy-dense granola. In fact, a recent study found <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/how-to-make-mason-jar-oatmeal-for-weight-loss\">oatmeal</a> to be the most satisfying breakfast in the cereal aisle—leading to greater and longer lasting feelings of fullness than ready-to-eat cereal. </p><p><br/><br/><strong><a target=\"_blank\n\" href=\"https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/NT/ETT/eat_this_not_that.jsp?cds_page_id=179628&amp;cds_mag_code=ETT&amp;id=1425531789444&amp;lsid=50632303094033617&amp;vid=1&amp;cds_response_key=W0115ET001\">FOR HUNDREDS OF HEALTHY SNACK AND WEIGHT-LOSS IDEAS, click here for our new book <em>Eat This, Not That! 1,247 Awesome Slimming Swaps</em>.

Just because your protein is a powder doesn’t mean you have to settle for one with a label that reads like a science experiment. These natural <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-protein-powder-every-goal\">plant-based protein powder</a> brands offer the protein you crave and serious nutritional benefits for every goal, from bodybuilding to <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss\">weight loss</a>. And though they’re delicious in blended protein shakes, all you need to do to enjoy them is add water:</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">1</div><div class=\"title\">Aloha Plant-Based<br/> Superfood Protein</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"aloha vegan protein powder\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/532777260/protein-powder-aloha.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/><strong>Protein Source:</strong> Hemp, pumpkin seeds and peas</p><p><strong>Protein Payoff:</strong> 18 grams</p><p>Milk the benefits of this tasty, plant-based protein powder by slipping it into one of your quick <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/10-smoothie-recipes-weight-loss\">weight loss smoothies</a> or <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/10-protein-shake-recipes-weight-loss\">protein shakes</a>. The organic, vegan protein powder is made with hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds and peas for an impressive punch of 18 grams of protein per serving — with no chemicals or artificial fillers. And while it may be gluten-free, soy-free and dairy-free, it’s certainly rich in flavor. When you try this in a shake recipe that is originally dairy-based, you’d swear it was the real thing from its rich texture and flavor. Try their wild harvested vanilla or fair trade organic cacao powder swirled into a quick shake with half a frozen banana for an ice cream-like texture and a tablespoon of nut butter for satiating healthy fats and some extra protein. </p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">2</div><div class=\"title\">Manitoba Harvest<br/> HempPro 70</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"manitoba harvest vegan protein powder\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/906873788/protein-powder-manitoba-hemp-pro-70.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/><strong>Protein Source:</strong> Hemp protein concentrate</p><p><strong>Protein Payoff:</strong> 14-20 grams</p><p>We love the post-workout high — sorry, not that kind of high — we get with this hemp-based protein powder that comes in swoon-worthy flavors like dark chocolate. Since hemp protein is easily digested, it’s a great pre-workout way to #buildmasswithoutmeat and make sure you don’t cramp up at the gym. And though hemp may conjure mental images of burlap and peaceful protests, make no mistake about the warrior strength of this protein and its health benefits. In addition to a hefty helping of plant-based <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/lose-weight-build-muscle-with-complete-proteins\">complete protein</a> per serving, hemp also boasts heart-healthy doses of anti-inflammatory omega-3s. As a break from the standard shake, we love sprinkling this powder into our <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/boost-the-health-benefits-of-oatmeal-with-these-toppings\">oatmeal recipes</a> and baking it into brownies for a healthy treat. While whey protein can agitate many, we love this allergen-free alternative for its versatility and flavor. </p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">3</div><div class=\"title\">PlantFusion</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"plantfusion vegan protein powder\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/709487054/protein-powder-plant-fusion.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/><strong>Protein Source:</strong> Pea, artichoke, quinoa and amaranth</p><p><strong>Protein Payoff:</strong> 21+ grams</p><p>You can choose from an array of sinful sounding flavors like cookies and cream and chocolate raspberry with this blend of pea and artichoke (yes, artichoke) protein and a proprietary enzyme blend. The powder also uses quinoa and amaranth, an ancient grain brimming with nutrients that may prevent cancer and have anti-inflammatory properties. The 21 grams of protein per serving should be enough to convince you to finally part with your old tub of whey. For a no-effort shake, combine two tablespoons almond butter, non-dairy milk of choice, half a banana, a sprinkle of cinnamon and PlantFusion cookies and cream protein powder. You can also throw in a handful of spinach for good measure; you won’t detect the mild-tasting green through the powder and sweet cinnamon.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">4</div><div class=\"title\">VegaOne</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"vega one vegan protein powder\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/979483425/protein-powder-vega-one.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/><strong>Protein Source:</strong> Pea protein and hemp protein</p><p><strong>Protein Payoff:</strong> 20 grams</p><p>Loaded with six servings of greens, probiotics, antioxidants and 50% of your daily intake of food-based vitamins and minerals, this super clean protein powder is difficult to turn down. With tasty flavors like vanilla chai and berry, water alone is enough to create a tasty shake you’ll actually like sipping. If you have more time, combine a scoop — which doles out 20 grams of protein — with unsweetened <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-worst-milk-alternatives\">milk alternatives</a> and a frozen banana for an irresistible milkshake-like creation. Created by a former Ironman triathlete, this balanced protein also tastes great in homemade protein muffins as a post-triathlon — or post-regular run — treat.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">5</div><div class=\"title\">Garden of Life<br/> Raw Protein</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"garden of life vegan protein powder\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/990070048/protein-powder-garden-life-raw.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/><strong>Protein Source:</strong> Organic sprouted protein blend (brown rice, amaranth, quinoa, millet and more) </p><p><strong>Protein Payoff:</strong> 17 grams</p><p>This complete protein showcases 13 raw and organic sprouts, with 17 grams of protein per serving, and all the essential amino acids your body needs. Just make sure you whip up a smoothie using a healthy fat like nut butter or avocado. Makers of this powder load it with fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, which can only be fully absorbed by your body when paired with a <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/8-fatty-foods-make-you-skinny\">healthy fat</a>. Their original unflavored powder works in any post-workout shake, but we’re suckers for slimming, satisfying chocolate versions. For an extra boost, try their Raw Fit  line, which hit the beach feeling your best — faster than ever. It's formulated to enhance weight loss, jumpstart your metabolism and maintain healthy blood sugar levels. Even better: This line is also all-natural and free of scary additives.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">6</div><div class=\"title\">SunWarrior<br/> Protein</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"sunwarrior vegan protein powder\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/233134088/protein-powder-sunwarrior.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/><strong>Protein Source:</strong> Pea, hemp, cranberry protein, brown rice and more</p><p><strong>Protein Payoff:</strong> 15+ grams</p><p>Another great raw protein option, this GMO-free powder derived its muscle-building power from raw organic pea, cranberry and hemp seed protein. Their classic vanilla protein powder relies on raw whole-grain brown rice protein for 15 grams a serving and pairs well with coconut milk for a refreshing, refueling beverage best enjoyed right after your workout. If you’re looking for a little extra protein and a more indulgent flavor, you can’t go wrong with their chocolate warrior blend. With two additional grams of protein per serving, this powder is easily digested — you can count on no belly bloat — and ideal for healthy weight loss.

Like red wine, black tea contains a great deal of tannins, dark-colored bitter plant substances that bind to teeth, leaving behind a yellow tint. But fear not, black tea lovers, this doesn’t mean you need to switch to another variety if you want to keep your pearly whites, well, white. There’s a simple, science-backed fix: add some <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-worst-milk-alternatives\">cow’s milk</a> to your mug—at least that’s what a recent report in the <em>Journal of Dental Hygiene</em> suggests.</p><p>To come to this discovery, researchers analysed the color of extracted human teeth before putting them into a solution of either tea or tea with milk for 24 hours. At the end of 24 hours, the researchers re-analyzed the color of the teeth and discovered that the chompers in the <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/5-best-teas-that-boost-your-calorie-burn\">tea</a> and milk mixture were far more vibrant than their tea-only counterparts. In fact, the researchers say that the addition of milk is far more effective than whitening toothpaste and equally effective as some bleaching products at keeping teeth white. </p><p>The research team says the casein, a type of milk protein, is to thank.

You know the journey ahead is going to be difficult, and getting started can feel overwhelming.</span> </p><p>But don’t let that deter or intimidate you. All you need to do is put one foot in front of the other and take small steps. There are a number of simple—but extremely effective—things you can do to ease into the weight loss process. And when you see those first few pounds start to fly off, you’re bound to motivated to push yourself further. </p><p>Here, weight loss experts outline the best ways to start <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss\">losing weight</a> when you want to shed 50 pounds or more.</p><h1 id=\"-div-class-number-head-mod-number-head-mod-standalone-div-class-header-mod-div-class-number-1-div-div-class-title-get-more-br-shut-eye-div-div-div-\"><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">1</div><div class=\"title\">Get More <br/> Shut-Eye</div></div></div></h1><p><img alt=\"how to lose 50 pounds sleep\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/758841865/night-light-8-ways-lose-weight-while-you-sleep.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><p>When you imagine your weight loss journey, <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/8-ways-to-lose-weight-while-you-sleep\">sleep</a> likely isn’t the first thing that comes to mind. But getting adequate shut-eye each night (about 7 or 8 hours) is one of the easiest and most effective ways to jump-start a weight-loss plan, says Dyan Tsiumis, founder of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://getfiercetraining.com/\">Get Fierce Training</a> in New York. Tsiumis, who dropped more than 70 pounds before becoming a personal trainer, says that “when the body is sleep deprived, it releases hormones that increase hunger and make it more challenging to recognize when you’re satiated.” Skimping on sleep also increases levels of stress hormones that cause fat storage and interfere with workout recovery. Once you’ve adjusted to a regular sleep schedule, you can move on to tackle an additional weight loss tip from the list below.</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>An hour before bed, turn off your electronics. Basking in their blue glow can make it difficult to fall asleep. </p><h1 id=\"-div-class-number-head-mod-number-head-mod-standalone-div-class-header-mod-div-class-number-2-div-div-class-title-hydrate-div-div-div-\"><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">2</div><div class=\"title\">Hydrate</div></div></div></h1><p><img alt=\"how to lose 50 pounds detox water\" src=\" http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/755819739/cantaloupe-spa-water.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><p>You’ve likely heard that you should drink eight cups of water daily, which is a whopping half-gallon. But Chris Powell, the trainer who has helped hundreds of overweight people lose major weight on ABC’s reality series <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/chris-powell-weight-loss-tips-extreme-weight-loss\">Extreme Weight Loss</a>, says contestants on the show down at least a gallon every day. But that’s not all: On days they hit the gym, they consume an extra 32 ounces for every hour they exercise. “Not only does this slightly increase their metabolism, but it also keeps them full between meals and wards off bouts of overeating. This strategy plays a key role in their extraordinary success!” he explains.  </p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>When downing a gallon of H20 is the goal, there’s little time left to consume other beverages. But we get it, sticking to water all the time can fatigue your taste buds. If that happens, skip the soda, juice and fancy <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/8-worst-coffee-drinks-in-america\">coffee drinks</a> and whip up a pitcher of <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/14-detox-waters-banish-bloat\">detox water</a> or green tea instead. Make sure you reach for green tea over black, as this brew contains belly fat-burning compounds called catechins.</p><h1 id=\"-div-class-number-head-mod-number-head-mod-standalone-div-class-header-mod-div-class-number-3-div-div-class-title-skip-br-the-gym-div-div-div-\"><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">3</div><div class=\"title\">Skip<br/>  The Gym</div></div></div></h1><p><img alt=\"how to lose 50 pounds workout gear\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/722057904/workout-gear-phone.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><p>If working out at a gym or in front of others makes you anxious—don’t do it. The best workout is one you will stick to. If you value your privacy, start off doing a low-impact exercise video at home or going for walks in your neighborhood. If you don't have much free time for physical activity, walk part of the way to and from work or during your lunch break—every bit of movement helps get you closer to your goal.</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Remember: Your workout routine doesn't have to be extreme to be effective.<br/>If you’re new to fitness, start by working out just 10 minutes three or four times a week. Every week after that, increase your time by three minutes. Before you know it, you’ll be moving for a half-hour or more.</p><h1 id=\"-div-class-number-head-mod-number-head-mod-standalone-div-class-header-mod-div-class-number-4-div-div-class-title-clean-br-your-kitchen-div-div-div-\"><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">4</div><div class=\"title\">Clean <br/> Your Kitchen</div></div></div></h1><p><img alt=\"how to lose 50 pounds supermarket\" src=\" http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/718312861/grocery-cart-11-food-industry-secrets.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><p>“Whether you have ten pounds to lose or 100, the first thing you should do is create an environment for success,” says Powell. Collect all the cookies, frozen nuggets, cakes and chips and donate them to a local food bank. When junk food isn’t in your home, you’re less apt to eat it regularly, which can accelerate your weight loss. After you’ve cleaned house, it’s time to hit the grocery store. Powell suggests <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/16-must-have-staples-flat-belly-kitchen\">restocking your kitchen</a> with natural whole foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, raw almonds and lean proteins like turkey, chicken, fish and eggs.</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Just because you tossed out the junk doesn't mean you need to deprive your sweet tooth completely. If you want to indulge in ice cream or a cookie go out once a week for a treat and savor it. After you’ve finished eating, leave the restaurant. The longer you linger, the higher the chance you’ll go for seconds.</p><h1 id=\"-div-class-number-head-mod-number-head-mod-standalone-div-class-header-mod-div-class-number-5-div-div-class-title-break-up-br-with-happy-hour-div-div-div-\"><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">5</div><div class=\"title\">Break Up <br/> With Happy Hour</div></div></div></h1><p><img alt=\"how to lose 50 pounds old fashioned\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/737408446/low-cal-cocktails-old-fashioned.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><p>Like soda and sugary drinks, booze is packed with hundreds of <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/worst-summer-cocktails-for-weight-loss\">empty calories</a> — but that’s not the only reason it can slow your weight loss progress, says Registered Dietitian Nutritionist <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://neilyonnutrition.com/\">Jennifer Neily</a>. “Drinking decreases inhibitions and increases appetite, causing people to eat far more than they otherwise would,” she says. In fact, a recently Dutch study found that consuming just half a drink resulted in study participants consuming 20 percent more than their sober counterparts. Yikes!</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Next time you go out, offer to be the DD so that you’re not tempted to drink.

Top UK Trainer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://instagram.com/teamdanroberts/\">Dan Roberts</a> suggests ditching the scale altogether focusing on your weight loss journey instead. “The fitness and diet industry bombards us with before and after transformations that reportedly happen overnight. However, these types of results aren’t typical. Mostly big changes take time, so be patient with yourself and focus on adhering to your diet and fitness routine and improving your overall health. Over time, the weight will naturally come off—don’t worry about what the scale says.”</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>If you’re a numbers person and want to track your progress, focus on your <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/most-accurate-weight-and-health-calculations\">waist-to-hip ratio</a>. This measurement, which is calculated by taking the circumference around the hips in inches and dividing it by the circumference of the waist, is an important indicator of health because it hones in on belly fat. This type of fat negatively impacts wellness more than fat that’s housed anywhere else on the body. Check your ratio monthly to ensure that you're still on track toward your goal.</p><h1 id=\"-div-class-number-head-mod-number-head-mod-standalone-div-class-header-mod-div-class-number-7-div-div-class-title-take-time-br-to-reflect-div-div-div-\"><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">7</div><div class=\"title\">Take Time <br/> to Reflect</div></div></div></h1><p><img alt=\"how to lose 50 pounds relaxing\" src=\" http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/179296018/body-insecurities-give-up.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><p>Losing weight can be just as hard both emotionally and physically. Remembering why you started your weight loss journey can help lift your spirits when you're down and motivate you to stick with it when you want to throw in the towel. “Take a moment each morning to remember what you're working for—whether it be improved energy so you can play with your children or a longer happier life, says Tsiumis. “When you focus on all the good that will come from all of your hard work it's easier to stay on track,” she adds. </p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Tsiumis suggests setting an alarm on your <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/6-ways-your-cell-phone-can-help-you-lose-weight\">cell phone</a> as a “motivation reminder.” “I have an alarm that goes off three times per day to remind me what I'm working for— and I lost my weight over ten years ago! It keeps my mind focused on being my best,” explains Tsiumis. </p><p><br/><br/><strong><a target=\"_blank\n\" href=\"http://www.zerobelly.com/\">LOSE UP TO 16 POUNDS IN 14 DAYS with <em>Zero Belly Diet</em>—the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling book from <em>Eat This, Not That!</em> author David Zinczenko.

Julie Odato, certified personal trainer and Program Director at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.weightlossretreat.com/jump-start-new-york.html\">Jump Start Retreats</a> in the Catskills, says staying on the diet is the hardest part, and has a trick for sticking to the program: &quot;Alternate days of your new diet plan with your normal <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/11-eating-habits-uncover-your-abs\">eating habits</a>,” she advises. “For example, do the new plan Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, and observe your regular habits Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.” You can also apply the same principle when it comes to adopting a healthier exercise routine. “At the end of the first seven days,” she says, “you will have improved your eating habits over half of the days of the week and will feel ready to launch into week two!&quot; The high you get from keeping it going for several weeks—not to mention the better body image—will eventually help you crowd out the bad eating patterns with even more good ones.</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Once you’ve gotten into the swing of a healthier routine, it’s easy to center your goals around numbers on the scale. Don’t. Instead, make them action-based.  David Chesworth, fitness specialist at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hhhealth.com/\">Hilton Head Health (H3)</a>, a world-renowned <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/weight-loss\">weight loss</a> destination on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina, explains: “We are creatures that desire instant gratification.  I hear ‘I want to lose 20 pounds,’ all the time. This is not a goal that easily sets you up for success.” Simply put, you’re setting yourself up for bucket o’cheese fries-infused failure. “[Instead, make your goals things like] going for a 30 minute power walk, or going to your favorite Zumba class after work on Fridays. As soon as you finish that Zumba class, you feel accomplished and fulfilled,” says Chesworth.  </p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">2</div><div class=\"title\">Ditch your<br/> food rules</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"weight loss tips food rules\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/332311758/couple-snacking.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>“When nourishing your body with foods, listen to what it needs,” says yoga instructor Carrie Seyer, who is leading an upcoming CorePower Yoga wellness retreat at <a href=\"http://www.twinfarms.com/\">Twin Farms</a> in Barnard, Vermont. “Discard dogma and food rules, and eat for fuel and energy, whatever that may be for that day.” As much as you can, she adds, “choose whole, unprocessed foods, but also allow for an occasional splurge or two to help maintain a healthy mindset. Our bodies are intelligent and always asking for what they need to function optimally, whether it’s vegetables or even a bit of sugar; there’s reason behind the craving.&quot;</p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>Eat This! Tip</strong></h3><p>So what exactly, you ask, should you eat? &quot;Improving your eating habits is a process of being practical, not perfect,” says Odato. “There are some specific foods that, realistically you know you will not live without. So, work with that. Keep that food to once a week or once a month instead of failing at never [eating it].” Or indugle guilt-free with these <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/50-best-healthy-snacks-for-weight-loss\">50 Best Snacks for Weight Loss</a>!</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">3</div><div class=\"title\">Move!</div></div></div><p>You think trying to get to the gym is tough? Try a week at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theranchmalibu.com/R4.0/program.php\">The Ranch 4.0</a> in Malibu. The daily routine “consists of 8-10 hours per day of rigorous exercise including four hours of morning mountain hiking and an afternoon full of <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-workouts-for-fat-loss-and-burning-calories\">exercise classes</a>, including core and ab work, weights, body toning and sculpting, daily group yoga sessions as well as a daily massage,” says Alex Glasscock, co-owner. “The intense daily physical regimen is complemented by a daily 1,400-calorie diet of vegetarian fare served in a charming private greenhouse setting.”  Since this kind of intense activity isn’t feasible (or advisable!) at home, think of simple ways to add more activity into your day—it all adds up. “Incorporate walking into your daily routine—take the stairs, park the car farther away and walk your dog,” says Glasscock. And make sure to avoid fitness ruts: “Vary your exercise routine so that you’re always testing your body—if you love spin, don’t do it seven days a week. Incorporate yoga, weights and other activities to work your whole body.” </p><h3 id=\"-eat-this-tip-\"><strong>Eat This!

You probably wouldn’t believe it—but one man did just that.</span></p><p>Iowa-based science teacher John Cisna dropped 60 pounds from his 280-pound frame during a diet experiment inspired by three of his students who were going to college to study medicine, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.AL.com\">AL.com</a>. He thought it would be fun to give them the opportunity to prove or disprove the hypothesis that eating nothing but McDonald's could improve a person’s health. Cisna’s students jumped on board and went on to plan his 2,000-calorie-a-day Mickey D’s diet, making sure it adhered to the FDA-recommended intakes of fat, sugar, <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/how-much-protein-do-you-need-on-your-weight-loss-diet-plan\">protein</a> and carbohydrates. </p><p>During the first three months of the experiment, Cisna's students came up with 56 different McDonald’s meal combinations. For breakfast, he enjoyed things like the Egg White Delight McMuffin and Fruit &amp; Maple Oatmeal. For lunch he noshed on the chain’s salads, yogurt parfaits and apple slices and every evening for dinner he ate an Extra Value Meal with a small order of fries. </p><p>Cisna also ramped up his <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/3-exercises-3-foods-6-pack-abs\">workout routine</a>, going for 45-minute walks four or five days a week. At the end of the 90-day classroom experiment, Cisna had lost 37 pounds and lowered his total cholesterol from 249 to 170. This inspired him to stick with the diet and exercise plan for another 90 days, during which he dropped an additional 28 pounds—and he’s pumped about the results.</p><p><img alt=\"mcdonalds weight loss\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/749297674/mcdonalds-weight-loss.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><p>&quot;In all those (previous) years, my nickname with my buddies was 'Snack Bar'. You know what they call me now? 'Snack Bar Jr.,&quot; he joked. Cisna is set to serve as the company's corporate brand ambassador until the end of 2016. However, he's quick to note that a McDonald's-only diet is not for everyone.</p><p>&quot;I'm not pushing McDonald's. I'm not pushing <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/fast-food-meals-under-350-calories\">fast food</a>. I'm pushing taking accountability and making the right choice for you individually,&quot; Cisna said. “Just because this experiment worked for me doesn't mean it's going to work for everybody else.”</p><p>And we agree. Though we don't endorse eating at the Golden Arches every day, it is possible to make weight loss-friendly choices if you find yourself at the fast-food joint—as proved by Cisna's overwhelming success.

A touch of cheesiness makes them savory enough to eat on their own in the case of a snack craving, but light enough to let your topping creations shine.</p><p><strong>Eat This! Because:</strong> They make it easy to build yourself a <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/50-best-healthy-snacks-for-weight-loss\">healthy snack</a>, without overloading on calories. The average cracker packs well over 100 carb-based calories per serving, leaving only a fraction of your snack calories left for toppings. At a mere 25 calories, you can pile four or five of these high with healthy toppings for a well-rounded snack that will keep you full for hours.</p><p><strong>Best Way to Eat It:</strong> Create satiating combinations that deliver all three main nutrients you need for a balanced snack: protein, carbs and healthy fats. Everything from turkey deli meat with small slices of avocado to an easy swipe of almond butter fits the bill. Get creative! You can even create mini Elvis-style sandwiches using the crisps as your base. The combinations are endless. To get even more out of your savory combinations, add a shake of red chili flakes to boost your <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/6-ways-to-boost-your-metabolism\">metabolism</a>.</p><p><strong>Secret Ingredient:</strong> A dedication to keeping it simple; just four easy-to-pronounce ingredients go into these wafers. The other flavors in their line use the perfect hint of spice to create a uniquely aromatic crisp that doesn’t overwhelm your palate. We're big fans of the rosemary crisps.</p><p><strong>Nutrition:</strong> 9 crisps: 50 calories, 0 g fat (0 g sat fat), 180 mg sodium, 10 g carbs, 1 g fiber, 0 g sugar, 2 g protein</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><a target=\"_blank\n\" href=\"https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/NT/ETT/eat_this_not_that.jsp?cds_page_id=179628&amp;cds_mag_code=ETT&amp;id=1425531789444&amp;lsid=50632303094033617&amp;vid=1&amp;cds_response_key=W0115ET001\">FOR HUNDREDS MORE HEALTHY SNACK AND WEIGHT-LOSS IDEAS, click here for our new book <em>Eat This, Not That! 1,247 Awesome Slimming Swaps</em>.

And in a separate study, researchers at Brigham Young University found that women who exercised for 45 minutes in the morning ate less and were more physically active for the rest of the day. But dragging yourself out of bed early does more than cut your cravings; men who ate a high-fat, high-calorie diet but exercised in the morning avoided <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/4-surprising-foods-cause-weight-gain\">weight gain</a> and insulin resistance and sped more protein to their muscles than men who didn’t, Belgian scientists discovered. Are you setting an earlier alarm yet?</p><p>But it’s not enough to roust yourself from bed at a virtuously early hour to hit the gym. You can partake in the most intense CrossFit workout imaginable, but if you’re making some common mistakes outside the gym, you run the risk of erasing your results. These are some ways you could be sabotaging your morning workout:</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">1</div><div class=\"title\">Eating late<br/> at night</div></div></div><p>Eating after 8pm isn’t the one-way ticket to weight gain it’s been made out to be. But if you have too big a meal too late, your body has to work to digest it overnight, disrupting your sleep and releasing the stress hormone cortisol, which causes weight gain. So be mindful of both when you eat and what. Jim White RD, ACSM HFS, owner of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jimwhitefit.com\">Jim White Fitness and Nutrition Studios</a>, says an effective morning workout begins with dinner the night before; he recommends brown rice, steamed broccoli and 3 to 5 ounces of <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/meat-free-proteins\">lean protein</a>.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">2</div><div class=\"title\">Not getting<br/> enough sleep</div></div></div><p>Getting enough shut-eye isn’t just key to having enough energy for your AM workout — it’s critical for <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss\">weight loss</a>. In fact, not getting enough sleep could undermine weight loss by as much as 55 percent, a recent <em>Canadian Medical Association Journal</em> study found. The reason: Lousy sleep impairs the hormone that controls appetite, making you crave carbs for energy, say researchers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Since morning exercise has been shown to improve sleep, getting in that habit will kickstart a positive cycle. The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults get seven to nine hours of sleep nightly, and recent research suggests the optimal amount is at the low end of that range. Unfortunately, some 69% of Americans say they don’t get enough sleep on the weekdays; to ensure you see the results of your work in the gym, don’t be one of them.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">3</div><div class=\"title\">Not eating<br/> beforehand</div></div></div><p>Whether you’re doing cardio or hitting the weights in the AM, you need to fuel up. There’s been a lot of recent publicity surrounding studies about exercising in a fasted state in the A.M, but the effectiveness of that approach is far from definitive, and nutritionists recommend having a light snack before any workout for energy. For a typical workout, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.katiecavuto.com\">Katie Cavuto</a>, dietitian for the Philadelphia Phillies and Philadelphia Flyers, suggests having 6 ounces of <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/9-best-yogurt-brands-to-eat-for-weight-loss\">yogurt</a> or a half-cup of fruit; Sean M. Wells, owner of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naplespersonaltraining.com\">Naples Personal Training</a>, recommends grabbing a banana, some almond butter and raisins. If you’re doing something more intense like CrossFit, you might want to load up with more calories; for personalized snacks, use our guide to <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-high-protein-foods-to-fuel-every-workout\">The Best Fuel for Every Workout</a>. </p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">4</div><div class=\"title\">Eating the wrong kind<br/> of pre-workout fuel</div></div></div><p>When it comes to pre-workout snacks, avoid hard-to-digest foods like the sweaty guy on the bench press. According to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nutritiontwins.com\">Tammy Lakatos Shames</a>, RDN, CDN, CFT, you should skip anything that’s high in fat, like avocado, or loaded with fiber, such as raw veggies or green juices. Those can lead to bloating, stomach upset and workout-interrupting bathroom breaks. And make sure you avoid these <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/7-unexpected-foods-you-should-avoid-before-exercise\">7 Foods That Will Ruin Your Workout</a>. </p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">5</div><div class=\"title\">Eating the wrong kind<br/> of post-workout fuel</div></div></div><p>Having an after-workout snack is key to recovery, ensuring that you see the results you’ve been working for. Starving yourself is not a virtue. <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/how-the-chocolate-milk-diet-can-help-you-lose-weight\">Chocolate milk</a> is the current hot post-workout drink for its muscle-building balance of good carbs and protein. White recommends a 2:1 ratio of low-fiber carbohydrates and protein, such as wheat puff cereal with half a banana and a cup of skim milk. If you supplement with a <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/best-protein-powder-every-goal\">protein powder</a>, go vegan to avoid the bloating milk-derived proteins such as casein and whey can cause. </p><p>And even if you work out in the AM, you should be mindful of eating for recovery all day. Researchers found that exercisers who ate a light protein snack before bed had improved protein synthesis and muscle recovery, in a recent study published in the journal <em>Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise</em>. What you should avoid at all costs: Protein bars, which are packed with unnecessary sugar and unnecessary calories.

To hit the nutritional mark at breakfast, consume two whole eggs, a glass of milk and a piece of fruit. Alternatively, you can enjoy a shake blended with almond milk, half a banana, a tablespoon of almond butter and a scoop of your favorite protein powder.” <em>— <a href=\"http://mohrresults.com/about-us/\">Chris Mohr Ph.D., RD</a>, nutrition expert and former sports nutritionist for the Cincinnati Bengals</em></p><p>“Diet shakes, bars and boxed meals are highly processed, filled with sugar, sodium and chemicals and provide little nutrition. Even so, many people in their teens and 20’s turn to these products to lose weight—and they often work in the short term. However, once we’re in our 30’s, insulin production is more sensitive to sugar and processed food, and our bodies tack those calories on as fat more readily. Stick with clean, healthy foods to keep your <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/8-strategies-to-increase-metabolism-and-lose-weight-fast\">metabolism</a> running strong and energy levels high.” <em>— <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kristinreisinger.com/\">Kristin Reisinger</a>, MS RD CSSD, founder and owner of IronPlate Studios</em></p><h2 id=\"skip-meals-to-save-calories\">Skip Meals to Save Calories</h2><p>“In the past, skipping meals might have helped you reach your weight loss goal, but after a certain age, the body wises up. The more you try to restrict, the more your body will store calories as fat in case it needs to use them. It’s important for health, energy and metabolism to eat every four to five hours.” <em>— Lisa Moskovitz, R.D., founder of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nynutritiongroup.com/\">The NY Nutrition Group</a></em></p><p>“Skipping meals not only zaps energy and makes you feel deprived, but also makes it more difficult to consume the nutrients needed for <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/supplements-diet-experts-swear-by-for-total-health\">total health</a> and weight maintenance. Although emerging research suggests caloric restriction or having fewer daily meals can promote weight loss and promote longevity, the findings aren’t strong enough to change longstanding recommendations. It's prudent to eat meals or <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/50-best-healthy-snacks-for-weight-loss\">snacks</a> at least three or four times daily—especially in the morning and afternoon while you're expending physical and mental energy. Consume low-calorie, filling foods (like vegetables, fruits and lean proteins) to promote a slow, steady weight loss.” <em>— <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://elisazied.com\">Elisa Zied</a>, MS, RDN, CDN</em></p><p>“Many people who are trying to lose weight will restrict their eating to just one daily meal. This may work for teens and those in their 20’s, but for most it doesn't work long term. When you skip meals, it can slow metabolism over time and lead to overeating. The trick is to eat consistently. Aim for three daily meals and one or two snacks throughout the day to keep blood sugar balanced and metabolism going strong.” <em>— Isabel Smith MS, RD, CDN, registered dietitian and founder of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.isabelsmithnutrition.com\">Isabel Smith Nutrition</a></em></p><p><img alt=\"diet tips for your 30s exercise\" src=\" http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/397429018/treadmill-run.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><h2 id=\"workout-to-undo-diet-indulgences\">Workout to “Undo” Diet Indulgences</h2><p>“As we age, lean muscle mass naturally decreases, and our metabolism slows down. Exercise is important to help maintain a lean body composition, but it doesn’t give us the freedom to eat a ton of excess calories. The calories burned from <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/exercises-to-blast-belly-fat\">exercise</a> generally don’t offset the calories consumed in food. Exercise for your health, but don’t rely on it to undo your dietary indulgences.” <em>— <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sarahkoszyk.com/\">Sarah Koszyk</a>, MA, RDN, owner Family. Food. Fiesta.</em></p><p>“When we're younger, eating healthier seemed pointless when you could just go to the gym 24/7 to lose weight. Unfortunately, as the body ages, exercise still has plenty of positive benefits, but weight loss is often not one of them. When it comes to dropping pounds, a healthy diet and moderate exercise—both <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/7-exercise-fitness-mistakes-that-prevent-weight-loss\">weight training</a> and cardio—are key. Since metabolism slows as we age, you need to focus on both aspects of wellness to stay on track. ” <em>— Lisa Moskovitz, R.D., founder of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nynutritiongroup.com/\">The NY Nutrition Group</a></em></p><p><img alt=\"diet tips for your 30s alcoholic drinks\" src=\" http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/886556667/low-calorie-cocktails-margarita-rocks.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><h2 id=\"save-food-calories-for-alcohol\">Save Food Calories for Alcohol</h2><p>“It’s common for college coeds to eat less food so they can drink alcohol that evening without taking in excess calories. Doing so is a bad idea at any age, but especially after 30. After you turn 30, you’ll likely have more responsibilities, and you need to be focused almost every day of the week. If you’re not eating healthy calories—in the form of lean <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/meats-that-burn-fat\">proteins</a>, whole grains and fresh produce—your energy will plummet, your skin will look awful and you’re likely to over-consume alcoholic beverages and gain weight.” <em>— <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.christinepalumbo.com/\">Christine M. Palumbo</a>, MBA, RDN, FAND, a Chicago-area registered dietitian and nutrition communications consultant</em></p><h2 id=\"drink-in-moderation\">Drink in Moderation</h2><p>“Yes, drinking in moderation is better than downing an entire bottle yourself, but any amount of alcohol is bound to catch up with you. As we age, the body doesn’t metabolize alcohol as efficiently, and drunk junk food cravings become harder to ignore. It’s also increasingly difficult to get a good night’s rest with alcohol in your system. While you may have been able to get away with minimal sleep in your 20’s, that’s not the case in your 30’s and beyond. Sleepless nights lead to carb and sugar cravings the next day, which can contribute to further weight gain.” <em>— <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://marthamckittricknutrition.com/\">Martha McKittrick, RD, CDE</a>, a New York City-based registered dietitian</em></p><p><img alt=\"diet tips for your 30s gluten free bread\" src=\" http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/982259510/gluten-free-healthy-foods-diet-experts-wont-eat.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/></p><h2 id=\"eliminate-bad-food-groups\">Eliminate “Bad” Food Groups</h2><p>“Axing carbs or dairy may help you cut calories, but it can also set you up for lower nutrient intake, which is increasingly hard on the body as it ages. If weight loss is your primary motivator for eliminating food groups, focus on reducing portions and eating nutrient dense versions of shunned foods instead. Rather than eliminating carbs, for example, keep portions small and stick with whole grains over refined varieties.” <em>— Elisa Zied, MS, RDN, CDN</em></p><h2 id=\"go-on-a-low-cal-diet\">Go on a Low-Cal Diet</h2><p>“When you were younger, you may have been able to starve yourself to drop a quick ten pounds before bikini season, but this is almost impossible once the age ‘odometer’ turns to 30. Not to mention, it’s really unhealthy. Little by little, the metabolism slows down, and it’s tougher to drop weight quickly. Also, when you’re young, you can bounce back physically from a quick weight loss, but it will take its toll and can cause skin problems, hair loss and diminished energy when you try it after 30.” <em>— Christine M. Palumbo, MBA, RDN, FAND, a Chicago-area registered dietitian and nutrition communications consultant</em></p><h2 id=\"weigh-yourself-regularly\">Weigh Yourself Regularly</h2><p>“While stepping on the scale can be a good measure of weight maintenance in your teens and 20’s, once you’re older things aren’t as simple. As we age we tend to lose muscle and store fat, but numbers on a scale won’t necessarily reflect that right away. To catch on to body composition changes, use a pair of your favorite jeans instead of a scale. Snug jeans are an indication that you should watch your diet and incorporate strength training into your fitness routine. This will help your body hold on to more muscle mass and keep your metabolic rate from plummeting.”  <em>— Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD, owner, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://marisamoore.com\">Marisa Moore Nutrition</a></em> </p><p><br/><br/><strong><a target=\"_blank\n\" href=\"https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/NT/ETT/eat_this_not_that.jsp?cds_page_id=179628&amp;cds_mag_code=ETT&amp;id=1425531789444&amp;lsid=50632303094033617&amp;vid=1&amp;cds_response_key=W0115ET001\">FOR HUNDREDS MORE WEIGHT-LOSS IDEAS, click here for our new book <em>Eat This, Not That! 1,247 Awesome Slimming Swaps</em>.

We think it’s time to hit your smoothie game out of the park with some creative — and crave-worthy — add-ins. Whether you’re looking to rev up <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/essential-foods-eat-weight-loss\">weight-loss</a> efforts, supercharge your daily energy, or just brighten up a case of SSFS (Summer Smoothie Fatigue Syndrome), these nutritious and slimming additions chefs swear  by will shake up your <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/only-smoothies-you'll-need-video\">weight loss smoothie</a> routine.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">1</div><div class=\"title\">Coconut<br/> oil</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"coconut oil smoothie ingredients\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/446712565/processed-foods-coconut-milk.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>If you’re an avid <em>Eat This, Not That!</em> reader, you already have this tropical oil in your kitchen for cooking. But chef Emilie Berner of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://furtherfood.com/\">Further Food</a>, an online community of folks with gastrointestinal conditions, explains why she wants you to mix some in your morning shake: “Coconuts are special because of their medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). The body can get the fuel from MCTs into the bloodstream and ready for use quickly because of this fat’s molecular structure.” This is the same reason fans of <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/you-can-now-make-bulletproof-coffee-instantly\">Bulletproof Coffee</a> spike their morning joe with MCT oil, but the benefits go far beyond an energy boost. Since the MCTs are quickly used for energy by your body, they’re less likely to be stored as fat, Berner explains. The healthy fat will also keep you full until your next meal time, slashing the chances you’ll reach for an unhealthy snack mid-morning.</p><h3 id=\"-drink-this-tip-\"><strong>Drink This! Tip</strong></h3><p>Berner’s favorite <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/coconut-oil-benefits\">coconut oil</a> smoothie is one that’s blended with papaya and vanilla powder. This simple combination delivers all the key nutrients you need in a balanced, satiating meal: carbs, protein and <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/8-best-fats-for-weight-loss\">healthy fats</a>. </p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">2</div><div class=\"title\">Flaxseeds</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"smoothie ingredients flaxseeds\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/120405683/superfoods-chia.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>For a refreshing drink with a health-supportive punch of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber, try the smoothie John Melfi, executive chef of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ovalroom.com/\">The Oval Room</a> in Washington, DC, relies on for fuel. “I like to make my green smoothies with apples, kale, wheat grass, blue green algae, flaxseeds, chia seeds, <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/11-best-worst-greek-yogurts-weight-loss\">Greek yogurt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/healthy-recipes-using-matcha-green-tea\">matcha powder</a>,” Melfi says. Don’t underestimate the addition of these tiny seeds. While they’re diminutive in size, their health benefits are anything but. They’re rich in omega-3 fatty acids, a type of healthy fat that you have to get from food, which can help fight off metabolism-slowing inflammation. And while fish and nuts tend to get all the praise as <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/surprising-omega-3-foods-for-fat-loss\">omega-3 foods</a>, one tablespoon of ground flaxseeds contains an impressive 1,597 mg of the fat.</p><h3 id=\"-drink-this-tip-\"><strong>Drink This! Tip</strong></h3><p>If you’re craving more protein or struggle to hit your daily target, add some silken tofu into your weight loss smoothie. It will impart a creamy, velvety texture and boost the protein content.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">3</div><div class=\"title\">Cinnamon</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"smoothie ingredients cinnamon\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/802892053/cinnamon-sticks.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>Mary Poppins had it all wrong — a spoonful of cinnamon is what you want. The spice may get the most play time in holiday desserts and sweet breakfast dishes like oatmeal, but it’s worth tipping into your smoothies, too. “Cinnamon isn’t just a spice you put in your smoothies to mask the flavor of spinach. It’s a wonderful, warming spice with bright qualities. Namely, it balances your blood sugar, and some studies show that it lowers cholesterol,” offers Berner. Researchers at Penn State have even found that a diet rich in spices like cinnamon can help reduce your body’s negative responses to eating meals high in fat.</p><h3 id=\"-drink-this-tip-\"><strong>Drink This! Tip</strong></h3><p>This sweet spice is the perfect addition to oatmeal thanks to its ability to help your body metabolize sugars and carbs, but some months it’s just too warm for a big bowl of oats. To get the same satisfying flavor, try an oatmeal-inspired shake. Berner suggests mixing raw oats — a source of waist-whittling <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/how-to-lose-weight-eating-resistant-starch\">resistant starch</a> — with banana, almond milk, cinnamon and vanilla for a summertime version of the morning staple. </p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">4</div><div class=\"title\">Purslane</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"smoothie ingredients purslane\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/286324106/purslane.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>Nina Curtis, the Executive Chef at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theranchmalibu.com/\">The Ranch at Live Oak / Malibu</a>, isn’t joking when she tells us purslane is “the little herb with the big heart.” Also known as verdolaga, this weed is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and boasts a unique flavor that’s a mix of bitter, sour and salty notes — pretend cucumber, lemon and pepper had a baby. In fact, Curtis notes, “it’s got more omega-3 fatty acids than some fish.” And that’s only the beginning of its healthy report card. Overall, this is one green that’s nutritional gold. It has anti-inflammatory properties, supports <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/7-best-foods-decrease-heart-disease\">heart health</a>, boosts vision, strengthens your immunity, increases circulation and promotes weight loss, Curtis tells us. One important note: If you or someone you know suffers from kidney stones, make sure to avoid purslane or cook it to eliminate any oxalic acid concerns.</p><h3 id=\"-drink-this-tip-\"><strong>Drink This! Tip</strong></h3><p>To make her Purslane Power Smoothie at The Ranch, Curtis combines a cup of coconut water, a cup of frozen blueberries, half a banana, a cup of purslane and a pinch of pink salt (optional for added mineral benefits). Blend all ingredients until smooth (about 45 seconds) in the order listed, being sure to add your leafy greens at the end, so you don’t over-process them. This recipes makes enough for two, so grab someone to cheers with you or save the rest for a mid-afternoon power boost.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">5</div><div class=\"title\">Turmeric</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"smoothie ingredients turmeric\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/343173638/turmeric-8-best-foods-instant-detox.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>It might not be the prettiest thing in the produce aisle, but this funny-shaped root that resembles ginger is worth a second glance. What’s hiding under this root’s knobby exterior is what matters; curcumin, a phenol that gives the spice its signature color, has powerful anti-inflammatory properties. But its true gift is the ability to disrupt the growth and spread of cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. You might think of turmeric as a staple for savory curries or in spice rubs for roasted meats, but it’s one of Berner’s go-tos in refreshing, light smoothies. Her signature sip combines the golden powder with coriander, a cooling spice because, as she explains, “it can heat the body up, which creates agitation for some.”</p><h3 id=\"-drink-this-tip-\"><strong>Drink This! Tip</strong></h3><p>“An odd, but lovely combo is turmeric, coriander, ginger, pineapple, cilantro, lime and coconut milk” Berner shares. For something less exotic, try a favorite of Meredith Haaz, Executive Chef at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://theranchmalibu.com/R4.0/place.php\">The Ranch 4.0</a> at Westlake Village: Combine 1/2 cup pineapple (chopped), 1 banana, 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric (or ½-inch piece fresh, peeled and chopped), ½-inch piece fresh ginger (peeled and chopped) and 1 cup coconut water (plus more if needed to blend). </p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">6</div><div class=\"title\">Ginseng</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"smoothie ingredients ginseng\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/361908837/ginseng-root.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>“It may sound unusual, but go out of your way to your local health food store to pick up ginseng powder or extract for smoothies,” suggests Executive Chef Domenico Apollaro of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lupoverdedc.com/home\">Lupo Verde</a>. “Ginseng's benefits are countless, from improving glycemic control to boosting your immune system, and it’s a potent antioxidant,” he says. Although this powder is best known for its inclusion in <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/7-best-natural-energy-drinks\">energy drinks</a>, it will actually give you more of a brain boost than an energy surge. The magic dosage you’re looking for: 200 mg. Participants in a study who took 200 mg of ginseng an hour before a cognitive exam scored significantly higher than those who didn’t take the supplement. So, the right time to take it is before a class, just not a workout class.</p><h3 id=\"-drink-this-tip-\"><strong>Drink This! Tip</strong></h3><p>For a shake that will electrify your taste buds, try Apollaro’s signature shake combining low-fat yogurt, banana, mango, raw almond and extract of ginseng. For an added kick, try a metabolism-boosting spice like cayenne or cinnamon.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">7</div><div class=\"title\">Camu Camu<br/> Powder</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"smoothie ingredients camu camu\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/449457450/camu-camu.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>When it comes to blending up a <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/10-smoothie-recipes-weight-loss\">healthy smoothie</a> to combat hangovers and morning-after-bloat, who would know better than those tending bar? <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandiegowineclassic.com/bio/personalities-bio-popup_Josenhans_Jeff.html\">Jeff Josenhans</a>, Cicerone, Level II Sommelier and Master Mixologist at The Grant Grill inside <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.usgrant.net/\">THE US GRANT</a> hotel shares his go-to: “I combine banana, Greek yogurt, chia seeds, vegan protein powder, almond milk, dried peanut butter and camu camu powder in my recovery power smoothie.” Though more research is needed, one study found that obese diabetic rats who ate camu camu had decreased symptoms of the disease. The berry, which dazzles with off-the-charts amounts of vitamin C, also contains amino acids and antioxidants. And since Josenhans happens to double as a Muay Thai fighter and master diver, we’ll take his word that this potent powder gets you feeling energized to make the most of your workout.</p><h3 id=\"-drink-this-tip-\"><strong>Drink This! Tip</strong></h3><p>This Brazilian fruit also contains ellagic acid, the same compound found in berries that may help play a role in fighting diabetes. You probably won’t be able to track down the fresh berries in your local grocer, so look for it in powder form for smoothies.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">8</div><div class=\"title\">Kale</div></div></div><p><img alt=\"smoothie ingredients kale\" src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/637679302/kale.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"/><br/>“While a lot of chefs use spinach as their go-to green when making smoothies, my favorite ingredient to use is kale,” says James Beard Award winning Chef-Partner Guillermo Pernot of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cubalibrerestaurant.com/\">Cuba Libre Restaurant &amp; Rum Bar</a>. And this leafy green addition ensures you can use a milk alternative worry-free since kale has more calcium per serving than milk. “It also has virtually no calories, plus it tastes delicious when combined with pineapple and lime. I also always add chia seeds to my smoothies; they’re packed with nutrients and keep me feeling full when I’m working in the kitchen for long hours or traveling with no time to eat,” Pernot adds.</p><h3 id=\"-drink-this-tip-\"><strong>Drink This!

But we wondered: When you pop the top, what are you really pouring into your body?</span></p><p>Energy-drink companies are helping popularize exotic-sounding compounds that even scientists don’t yet fully understand. The approach has worked: In 2009, Americans spent $4.2 billion on these supposedly high-octane elixirs. But do these beverages really energize your body and sharpen your mind? Or should you can the energy drinks for good? </p><p>To help you separate the science from the marketing hype, we analyzed five key ingredients in the market’s most popular potions.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">1</div><div class=\"title\">Ginseng</div></div></div><p><strong>What Is It?</strong> An extract made from the root of the ginseng plant. Panax ginseng is the species most commonly used. The ginseng content in energy drinks typically ranges between 8 milligrams and 400 milligrams in 16 ounces.</p><p><strong>Does It Work?</strong> Not if you’re hoping for energy to burn. A recent review in <em>American Family Physician</em> determined that ginseng doesn’t enhance physical performance. But there is an upside: It may boost your <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/10-best-brainpower-boosting-secrets\">brainpower</a>. Andrew Scholey, PhD, an herb and nutrition researcher at Australia’s Swinburne University, and his colleagues found that people who swallowed 200 milligrams of the extract an hour before taking a cognitive test scored significantly better than when they skipped the supplement. They also felt less mental fatigue. Ginseng may work by increasing the uptake of blood glucose by cells in the brain, says Scholey. However, the right amount is essential—only two of the eight major energy drinks we examined contained that optimal dose of at least 200 milligrams.</p><p><strong>Is It Safe?</strong> Because the amount of ginseng in an energy drink is minimal, harmful effects are unlikely. And while there have been some reports of negative side effects from ginseng—diarrhea, for example—Scholey points out that those occurred in people taking 3 grams a day. One caution: If you’re on any medications, check with your doctor before knocking back an energy drink. Ginseng has been shown to impede blood-thinning drugs like warfarin.</p><h2 id=\"bottom-line\">BOTTOM LINE</h2><p>A potential brain boost, but don't expect any extra energy or physical prowess.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">2</div><div class=\"title\">Guarana</div></div></div><p><strong>What Is It?</strong> A South American shrub. One seed has a <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/surprising-foods-that-have-caffeine\">caffeine content</a> of 4 to 5 percent, while a coffee bean has 1 to 2 percent. The amount of guarana in a 16-ounce energy drink ranges from a minuscule 1.4 milligrams to as much as 300 milligrams.</p><p><strong>Does It Work?</strong> Yes, if you don’t set the bar too high. A study in the journal <em>Appetite</em> reports that people who took 222 milligrams of guarana felt slightly less fatigued and were up to 30 milliseconds faster on a reaction-time test than those who popped a placebo. Some scientists attribute guarana’s effect solely to its caffeine content, but Scholey isn’t so sure. His team found energizing effects with doses just under 40 milligrams, which contains little caffeine. That means there’s probably something else in guarana that produces a stimulating effect on its own or that bolsters the effect of the caffeine, he says.</p><p><strong>Is It Safe?</strong> Scientists at Florida’s Nova Southeastern University recently conducted tests and concluded that the amounts of guarana found in most energy drinks aren’t large enough to cause any adverse effects. That said, there’s still a question mark regarding the safety of higher levels, which could conceivably be consumed by downing a few energy drinks in a brief time span. For a sure pick-me-up, rely on these <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/7-energizing-foods-better-than-redbull\">energy boosting foods</a> instead.</p><h2 id=\"bottom-line\">BOTTOM LINE</h2><p>Guarana may fight fatigue and improve reaction time.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">3</div><div class=\"title\">Taurine</div></div></div><p><strong>What Is It?</strong> One of the most abundant <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/lose-weight-build-muscle-with-complete-proteins\">amino acids</a> in your brain, where it can act as a neurotransmitter—a chemical messenger that allows your cells to communicate with one another. You’ll find anywhere from 20 milligrams to 2,000 milligrams of taurine in most 16-ounce energy drinks.</p><p><strong>Does It Work?</strong> Scientists aren’t sure, but it doesn’t seem likely. When taurine is dumped into your bloodstream—when you down a Red Bull, for instance—it can’t pass through the membranes that protect your brain, says Neil Harrison, PhD, a professor of pharmacology at Weill Cornell Medical College. But even if it could, Harrison’s research suggests that taurine might behave more like a sedative than a stimulant. When he and his team applied the amino acid to the brain tissue of rodents, they discovered that it mimicked<br/>a neurotransmitter that slows brain activity.</p><p><strong>Is It Safe?</strong> Taurine is probably fine in small doses, but chug too many energy drinks and the picture becomes less clear. According to a recent case report from St. Joseph’s Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, three people had seizures after drinking two 24-ounce energy drinks in a short period of time. However, the researchers don’t know whether to blame the taurine or the caffeine. The fact is, there’s been little research on taurine consumption in humans, so it’s impossible to conclude whether it’s safe to consume in high doses.</p><h2 id=\"bottom-line\">BOTTOM LINE</h2><p>It doesn't appear to boost energy levels, and may actually deplete them.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">4</div><div class=\"title\">Caffeine</div></div></div><p><strong>What Is It?</strong> A chemical compound that stimulates your central nervous system. Most energy drinks contain between 140 and 170 milligrams of caffeine in a 15- or 16-ounce can.</p><p><strong>Does It Work?</strong> Java junkies certainly think so. As for the science, an Austrian study showed that men who swallowed 100 milligrams of caffeine had a bigger boost in brain activity after 20 minutes than those who took a placebo. Plus, a new University of Chicago study found that a 200-milligram jolt made fatigued people feel twice as alert as noncaffeinated participants.</p><p><strong>Is It Safe?</strong> The most caffeine-packed energy drink contains the equivalent in caffeine of about two 8-ounce cups of coffee. If downing that much joe doesn’t make you jittery, then quaffing a can shouldn’t pose a problem. Of course, if you combine that with other caffeinated beverages throughout the day, then the sum total stimulation could cause headaches, sleeplessness, or nausea. On the other hand, if you’re not a regular coffee or cola drinker and you battle high blood pressure, the occasional energy drink could be trouble. Researchers in Finland reported that the caffeine in 2 to 3 cups of coffee can cause blood pressure to spike by up to 14 points.</p><h2 id=\"bottom-line\">BOTTOM LINE</h2><p>Caffeine can increase alertness and brain activity. It can also increase the jitters, so use wisely.</p><div class=\"number-head-mod number-head-mod-standalone\"><div class=\"header-mod\"><div class=\"number\">5</div><div class=\"title\">Glucose</div></div></div><p><strong>What Is It?</strong> Sugar. Sucrose, another ingredient you’ll often see on energy drink labels, is a combination of fructose (the natural sugar found in fruit) and glucose. Many energy drinks contain 50 to 60 grams of glucose or sucrose in a 16-ounce can.</p><p><strong>Does It Work?</strong> Your body runs mainly on glucose, so topping off your tank with the sweet stuff should theoretically provide an instant boost. And in fact, a recent study in the <em>Journal of Applied Physiology</em> found that men who guzzled a 6 percent glucose drink were able to bicycle 22 minutes longer than those who went sans the extra sugar. Where glucose won’t help, however, is with the fog of fatigue from too little sleep. A 2006 British study determined that sleep-deprived people who drank liquid glucose exhibited slower reaction times and more sleepiness after 90 minutes than those who drank nothing.</p><p><strong>Is It Safe?</strong> Dumping <a href=\"http://www.eatthis.com/7-foods-with-little-nutritional-value\">empty calories</a> down your gullet is never a great idea, and some energy drinks contain nearly as much sugar as a 20-ounce soda. Then there’s the fact that a sudden infusion of glucose can cause your blood sugar and insulin levels to skyrocket, signaling your body to stop incinerating fat. A 2006 New Zealand study reveals that caffeine combined with even the 27 grams of sugar in, say, an 8.3-ounce Red Bull may be enough to temporarily inhibit your body’s ability to burn lard.</p><h2 id=\"bottom-line\">BOTTOM LINE</h2><p>Our bodies run on glucose, but using sugar as your energy source is a recipe for obesity.</p><p><br/><br/><em>Image: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery-809503p1.html?cr=00&amp;pl=edit-00\">Twin Design</a> / <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/editorial?cr=00&amp;pl=edit-00\">Shutterstock.com</a></em></p>","author":"Eat This, Not That!","images":[{"title":"","description":"","author":"Eat This, Not That!","url":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/902778549/redbull-energy-drink-xl.jpg","thumbnail":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/902778549/redbull-energy-drink-xl.jpg"}],"date":{"published":"2015-08-20T12:27:14.000Z","updated":"2015-08-17T12:09:00.000Z"},"link":[{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://www.eatthis.com/how-safe-are-energy-drink-ingredients"}],"relatedLinks":[[{"rel":"related","href":"http://www.eatthis.com/healthy-foods-that-increase-sexual-stamina","thumbnail":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/319533689/chili-peppers-sexual-stamina-md.jpg","mediaType":"text/html","title":"8 Foods That Increase Sexual Stamina","author":"Eat This, Not That!","description":"Increase sexual stamina and libido simply by eating these healthy foods regularly."},{"rel":"related","href":"http://www.eatthis.com/9-amazing-photos-people-getting-in-on-fat-yoga-trend","thumbnail":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/190454865/upward-dog-yoga-move-md.jpg","mediaType":"text/html","title":"9 Amazing Photos of People Getting In On The “Fat Yoga” Trend","author":"Eat This, Not That!","description":"These strong, bendy-bodied men and women will motivate you to move—no matter what your size."},{"rel":"related","href":"http://www.eatthis.com/5-foods-make-you-look-younger-video","thumbnail":"http://s3.amazonaws.com/etntmedia/media/images/ext/953451162/heirloom-tomatoes-md.jpg","mediaType":"text/html","title":"5 Foods That Make You Look Younger","author":"Eat This, Not That!","description":"These best healthy foods for beauty will make you look and feel younger and more vibrant and glow from the inside out."}]]}]}
